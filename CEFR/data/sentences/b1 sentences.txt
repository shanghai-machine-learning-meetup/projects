But for how long?
The drI've to Mr.
Finally, he said.
I already looked.
Your objective is
That will be all.
They looked down.
Do you know that?

He looked around.
He looked uneasy.
He looked at Mrs.
Well, guess what?

He looked anyway.

Big time, I think.

And the only thing
What happened, 85?
Its locked anyway.
You do understand?
Ill be your guide.
Ian finally asked.
Ill see you later.
We can talk later.
It seems I've been
You misunderstand.
Ill be very quiet.
And he looked old!
How have you been?
the podcam anyway.
Finally, one came.
Finally, he spoke.
Polaroid, I think.
I think we need to
Please forgive Dr.
How shall we live?
He didnt survI've.
Or anyway, Im not.
Once shed arrI'ved
Shiver me timbers!
I think I saw her.
Finally, shebegan.
I think Ill stand.
I paced nervously.
Finally he sighed.
I dont understand.
Finally I want No.
I think were good.
I understand, sir.
Not alone, anyway.
Finally she said: 
finally managed it.
he finally shouted.
I never said I did.
What have you done?
Were fugitives, Mr.
Will looked around,
Shew you all alive 
She looked at Will.
Mum looked abashed.
Who are you anyway?
I see, said Butler.
Reynie looked down.
Why didnt I see it?
And then I see him.
I never think that.
He never complains.
What have you seen?
As long as I live .
Ian, what happened?
Wild boar, I think.

I've been thinking.
May I see it again?
Then what happened?
How do you know my 
I think so, Butler.
How long do I have?
They never changed.
The drI'ver stepped
Finally he gave up.
I think about this.
he asked nervously.
Dmitri looked back.
I was just nervous.
Mary looked around.
A moment later Mrs.
I think it was him.
Oh, it gives me the
I mean, impressive.
Stink looked again.
Benedicts Receiver.
Skunk asked anyway.
Will looked around.
Guess what I found?
Olive trees nearby 
I think shes awake 
How I've missed him.
You dont understand!
You dont understand.
Payne, Oliver Payne.
Nervous tension, the
Ill be in touch, eh?
How long do we have?
OK, he said finally.
Take the initiative.
Keeping busy, I see.
I think they must be
May I see the skull?
I think her juice is
So small she looked!
Sophie looked at Mr.
Finally she grunted.
Looked like a queen.
At least I think so.
Dont you understand?
They finally slowed.
I've forgotten mine.
Who would live here?
Anyway, Im shielded.
What was I thinking?
He never gotover it.
I see where we are  
I see what you mean.
I see, said Artemis.
She never comes out.
What have you found?
Well tell you later.
He looked up atPrue.
What isthat, anyway?
She looked at Sadie.
About half, I think.
Makes me so nervous,
know she never will.
give it a rest, Rec.
give me the lymrill.
Why, I've never met  
he finally asked her.
How long have we got?
How do you know that?
I see, fibbed Butler.
Seamus asked finally.
I see, said Thatcher.
He laughed nervously.
She looked at Reynie.
He looked all around.
And I've got my work.
The drI'ver eased the
Anyway, I deserve it.
Septimus looked down.
He looked and looked.
Anyway, Mary went on.
Yes, sir, I think so.
Did he give a reason?
I refused to give up.
Is Rasta still alive?
They looked doubtful.
His mother was alive.
Oh, who cares anyway.
Then four, then five.
Then he looked at the
They never came back.
guess what they were.
Reynie looked around.
How do you know about
Do you not understand
Yes, he said finally.
Do you know Shadrack?
Reynie asked finally.
He wasnt the only one
A moment later he had
Your Nick is the only
What happened to him?
Stink looked at Judy.
No use to you anyway.
Sticky looked at him.
Finally, Sticky said.
Youll get used to it.
I give in, said Judy.
I think they like us.
curious than nervous.
Judy looked at Stink.
brain fluid, I think.
What happened to you?
First, what happened?
I finally choked out.
Milligan looked down.
What can you give me?
She turned and looked
I already understand.
May I see Mother now?
So where do you live?
Finally he swallowed.
Sticky looked at her.
PREEMPtive ABSOLUTION 
Tell me what happened.
When I arrI'ved at Mr.
give Constance a ride.
arrI'ved in the foyer.
Yes, of course, I see.
Here, give me the key.
You live in the lap of
Maybe it will be nice!
Coulter, if hes alive?
You mean Im the only ?
said Doodah nervously.
Helooked over at Prue.
Anyway, from below its
A different unI'verse.
Richard finally spoke.
Balthamos looked away.
Will looked back once.
We will be victorious.
Finally, Xaphania, Mr.
Enoch had many wI'ves.
He never had a chance.
He looked up at Angus.
Stickys lip quI'vered.
Benedict saving lives?
Rasmussen defensively.
What happened to them?
We might not survI've.
I think you look fine.
When he looked around!
Reynie looked at Kate.
Finally, he managed to
Mom, do you know them?
I see two-man patrols.
For now anyway, I say.
Key from the Archives.
But five minutes later
Constance looked away.
Youre out late, I see.
But then later on Mrs.
I've heardthe stories.
They set an explosive!
give it a few minutes.
Can you understand me?
with this girl anyway?
And Lyra will be safe?
I've been training the
We wont live, will we?
They made him nervous.
Kate looked quite sick.
RI'vers flow backward .
Do you know what to do?
Reynie asked nervously.
Classic nervous traits.
You understand me, boy.
David, I've got to run.
OK, said Foaly finally.
understand, old fellow.
A few minutes later Mr.
Do you know him, Mulch?
And then what happened?
I dont understand this.
Least I've never heard.
He looked back at Kate,
He looked back at Prue.
asked the PI nervously.
He looked over at Prue.
He looked hardly human.
I think I saw that one.
And I've made it worse.
said Mervall nervously.
She looked over at Mac.
Ah, I see it, she said.
Dont give me that look!
I see, muttered Butler.
I've seen dogs do that.
Chix hovered nervously.
Chix coughed nervously.
I've just completed it.
He looked up at Reynie.
The other way, I think.
Well fill you in later.
Find out what happened.
I wonder what happened.
Whats a Gemini, anyway?
anyway, without safety.
They arent now, anyway.
Helooked at the others.
Thatcher finally spoke.
Im sure you understand.
I've never seen a mouse
I felt I had no choice.
Once I've jumped to it.
You make me so nervous.
I've been saving it up.
Said Id give him a lift.
Mary looked up uneasily.
Anyway, the Hollycopter.
give herroom to breathe!
Of course, he never did.
The only idea he had was
Dont you understand yet?
That sounds pretty good.
give a holler if you see
And you had many wI'ves.
I never saw them before.
Finally, Angus spoke up.
Well collect them later.
Ill explain later, Pati.
Kate looked crestfallen.
Finally they drew apart.
I think he already does.
I've been expecting you.
They never had a chance.
I think he swallowed it!
Just how long was I out?
How long will that take?
The drI'ver waved at the
His drI'ver, finding him
Again with the opinions.
Benedict had given them.
I understand completely.
What is garbage, anyway?
I think I see something!
Thats something, anyway.
I think I will fight on,
Look what happened here.
Thatwould give you away.
You've given me an idea!
I never got no schoolin.
Maybe shes coming later.
I've been going over Mr.
How long will it take to
He looked overat Curtis.
See you later, and watch
And a moment later, Mrs.
What have you got there?
And I wonder how long it
Who lives in thatcastle?
She looked up at Curtis.
She looked up at Reynie.
I understand everything.
He was like them, alive.
Back later, it had said.
Theydarent let her live.
When was he alive, then?
But you dont understand!
Sticky looked horrified.
I didnt like him anyway.
You cant give that away!
Come, she said, finally.
But were the onlyone Mr.
I've rested long enough.
I've got to go and look.
Artemis used to do that.
I think its because Mrs.
What happened out there?
Finally, a breakthrough.
Raajhi seemed satisfied.
THE RI'veRS AND THE SEA 
Time to retire, I think.
Whats not to understand?
Three, she said finally.
Some champagne, I think.
Does it give you a rash?
give em a moving target!
They arrI'ved last week.
And guess what, my dear?
Richard looked relieved.
So what have you got for
THE ASS AND HIS DRI'veR 
But I think Ill make it.
I bet shell forgive you.
I never thought of that.
For later, he explained.
Garrotte, you drI've me.
nothing has lived since.
I see you on the filter.
I think were safe enough.
I've just got to go home.
I think this could be it.
What happened to the boy?
I dunno, he said finally.
THE FOXES AND THE RI'veR 
repeated Holly nervously.
Anyway, its not that bad.
Jackson looked surprised.
What have you done, Fowl?
Not till I've found Lyra.
I live therefore I learn.
The Archives, said David.
He came along much later.
What have you done, Opal?
What about the next clue?
Someone has finally come.
So, what happened to you?
What have you got for me?
I've got to get Mac back.
When they arrI'ved at the
Ian, I think youre right!
Finally he sighed and set
Fredle looked at Patches.
She never liked this bit.
I give up, he said slyly.
Finally, sighed Vassikin.
He lookedaround the room.
You can fill me in later.
Hed never get used to it.
But I think I am sad now.
Well give you the papers!
Hed already looked at it.
You dont understand, Jon.
Curtis looked nonplussed.
Ill be the first to admit
Too hard for him, anyway.
All I see is a heat blur.
And their families lives.
He was most appreciative.
Do you know what it says?
Yes, I thinkwe can do it.
Do you know how it opens?
Holly, what have you got?
The others looked at her.
How do you know all this?
I see, said Holly slowly.
You used to get them when
Do you understand, Short?
Well, if its so sensitive
And how do you know that?
Anyway, dead Mud Men dont
attractive by the moment.
Curtain looked at Reynie.
I looked at your seedpod.
There will be no talking!
My people cant live here.
Look what happened to me,
usually thinking, anyway.
She arrI'ved before dawn.
Finally, a stroke of luck.
Bryn, she said decisively.
What happened to idiot and
Oh, Will, hes still alive!
Constance looked confused.
Did we build the Archives?
I've heard about you four.
Oh, I've no doubt she did.
I see something, portside.
Connor looked crestfallen.
I've got a lot on my mind.
Fredle also looked around.
And how long will it take?
His words made her shiver.
Holly could understand his
Ill be working on it, too.
At least I've been trying!
Finally, her mother spoke.
move here till I was five.
Then looked at each other.
Youre going up the rI'ver.
Lyra looked up, wide-eyed.
Loafers finally caught on.
In fact, I think we should
Of course it will be good!
arrI've in two weeks time.
You must give something in
Finally, the day had come.
But I must keep her alive.
commander will understand.
I've been waiting all day.
What happened to your eye?
Iguess I've misremembered.
What happened toyour legs?
I've got to go, said Prue.
I've noticed, Fredle said.
You will never question me
The noise I think damaged.
Call it collateral damage.
Ill give you some privacy.
Miss Boons head swI'veled.
Finally it all made sense!
I've seen pictures of Mrs.
A bodyguard, I understand.
Meet our friendly drI'ver?
He looked utterly drained.
I think Ive mentioned her.
Finally Miss Kraken spoke.
Who made you king, anyway?
Anyway, its not our fault.
Finally Lord Asriel spoke.
To a golden eagle, anyway.
Who needed danger, anyway?
You wouldnt understand it.
Now Kate looked regretful.
Several minutes later, Mr.
I think you should shield.
He looked back at Brendan.
Something in the Archives.
I think hes in the galley.
They willnot let her live.
Will would have to give in
handed them the next clue.
Do you understand,Artemis?
What do you know about it?
She looked around her; she
What do they want, anyway?
where the moon used to be.
Yeah, I've got some stuff.
He approached tentatively,
Anyways, continued Vishby.
What have you got in there?
Well,anyway, the otters do.
This house will be watched.
I think weve got something!
Do you know how to stop it?
Figurative snakes, that is.
Those things are expensive.
Well talk about this later.
Well, what happened to her?
Just where is here, anyway?
There be five clues in all.
I think we have it, Butler.
What are you doing, anyway?
I would have helped anyway.
Finally her breath ran out.
give us an air, said Angus.
I was so nervous, you know.
Kate looked at him askance.
Twisty branches of the live
I've used this ship before.
gravely and looked at Prue.
What am I seeing here, kid?
Finally, someone remembers.
Finally she shook her head.
Mary looked under the tree.
They will be here tomorrow.
Its where the Helpers live.
He paused to sniff the air.
Stink looked up, squinting.
Its a good ploy and anyway,
Sticky looked disappointed.
Anyway, youre all here now.
Fredle looked at the thing.
As I used to say in France.
Reynie looked back at Kate.
He tapped his ear receiver.
Reynie looked at the floor.
He shook it appreciatively.
I think its safer that way.
Maybe we should all go, Mr.
You've got mail to deliver.
A moment later he did know.
How long ago did it happen?
She looked right at Fredle.
A half hour later, even Mr.
How long to the theme park?
How long have we been gone?
therefore we must have won.
Small pieces, I understand.
Hurry up and give me a map.
Hop in, Illgive you a ride.
How do you know about that?
receiver and turned to Max.
How do you know I dont like
Nod once if you understand.
Yes, sir, I finally mutter.
I see Artemis has woken up.
Ill be spoiled before long!
That will be our guarantee.
He went to find Mom anyway.
Wow, breathed Prue finally.
Youll never guess what Bea 
For a mouse it was, anyway.
I never want to move again!
I never say no to baseball.
You will be welcomeamong us.
The men looked at each other
It will be Agents or Mystics
And did he live in my world?
A five-thousand-dollar bill!
Benedict will never give up.
I never even met Al Capone .
How can you still be eating?
It looked longer than usual.
Curtains trusted Executives.
Everything made him nervous.
I think you have Pluto-itis.
Field mice live in the barn?
Pleased to meet you finally.
I never got involved before.
I think Dad believed us now.
Ill be fine, he assured her.
Kate looked at him cockeyed.
Lets not give them any help.
Rhonda will be with yousoon.
Very well, said the drI'ver.
And will she come out alive?
Holly felt suddenly nervous.
Do we understand each other?
Ill be twelve this November.
Cooper removed the receiver.
Constance looked frightened.
We will see about you later.
Reynie looked quickly about.
Will looked around the cave.
And how can Will be a witch?
He will be the first to pay.
Prue looked at him sideways.
David swI'veled in his seat.
And you werent the only one.
Oh, I think I have a choice.
The others alllooked to him.
Well have to feed you later.
Drowsiest kid I've ever met.
By then it will be too late!
I think they will be needed.
Whats wrong with him anyway?
He blinked and looked again.
For how long depends on you.
Not to be distracted, I see.
Anyway, that is unimportant.
What have you done with him?
Shelooked back down at Prue.
I dont, replied the drI'ver.
To give each other big hugs?
know, people will be slaves.
Its time for science anyway.
What do you know of the LEP?
But now, I think Ill keepit.
Had they really not forgiven
So she might still be alive.
Ill tell him when I see him.
It was the only thing to do.
She looked into the rafters.
A moment later, he was gone.
Thats exactly what happened.
Finally, theres your father.
What have you done, Artemis?
I think Im getting an ulcer.
I get itchy when Im nervous.
Max looked at it doubtfully.
The Royal Navy had arrI'ved.
Finally, he gave a happy Aha!
You keep live specimens here?
Penny looked back at the man.
Wont the water freeze anyway?
I think somethings not right.
Youll drI've the kid to ruin.
Number Two, dont drI've away.
They live with cats and rats?
Welcome to the Archives, Max.
I've heard so much about you.
We will give him his privacy.
But Theo refused to sit down.
Cormac looked at her blankly.
Ogunwe looked at her levelly.
We lost thirty-five in total.
Finally, her father spoke up.
Whats that drain for, anyway?
Whats a station word, anyway?
Prue looked back at the hole.
And what happened to you two?
What was a flau tower anyway?
give thanks to the Authority.
I dont think Ill be up to it.
I see whatmust have happened.
Nobody, said Max defensively.
Was anything alive out there?
And I think wed prefer not to
And anyway, that was before .
He did not survI've the fall.
I think I know, said Artemis.
She looked into the darkness.
Well, understand this, human.
I think I might take a closer
Enver chirped appreciatively.
Why doesnt anyone live there?
Max blinked and looked again.
Anyway, it was really stinky.
I think you should be the one
They never lived long anyway.
He looked at Prue and smiled.
Well, he said, what happened?
I think youre probably right.
Anyway, I've had a fine life.
The hard part will be digging
The girl is captive in a cave
She looked like a headhunter!
Will looked around, startled.
Benedicts Receiver, remember?
Benedicts friends to arrI've.
Root was right to be nervous.
Doyou understand, little dog?
He looked Reynie up and down.
What do you know of my lemur?
I've never been above-ground.
Its better to live presently.
She looked at him doubtfully.
He never even got a shot off.
Anyway, themoment has passed.
Finally the oldest man said: 
It is a bit constraintive, S.
I've learned from experience.
The covetous are poor givers.
I think it makes her nervous.
Hi, Max, she said tentatively.
Here he paused and looked over
You will never see them again.
Curtain looked at him askance.
I never invite Theresa either.
I never met a leader like you.
This is what I think, he said.
But the woman, she came later.
Lets go, said Foaly nervously.
By the gods, I think it would.
I dont think elves lived here.
Ill be taking these, she said.
Not the one you think, anyway.
We cant live in the mountains.
Instantly he looked regretful.
Obviously I've made a mistake.
But the Gallivespian was dead.
And Im getting thirsty anyway.
We are Gallivespian, she said.
I doubt anyone will be coming.
How do you know these secrets?
Naw, said Connor dismissively.
Oh, I see  youre insulting me.
to sweat and fidget nervously.
That she looked like a pencil?
Webster finally hit the piata!
The Grove, he finally spouted.
Forgive us, she said to Iorek.
And yet it all looked so real.
Yeah, whyd you do that anyway?
She never played jokes on him.
Do you know how many times Ive
What was your present, anyway?
Dont give him too hard a time.
He frowned but finally nodded.
I think Id better go home now.
A shiver ran through the ship.
Why dont you fellows give it a
He looked away and found Lyra.
I understand all right, Spiro.
Max looked at him impatiently.
Why havent I seen this before?
Just give me a moment, is all.
What happened with Pipers mom?
For my first act, I give you .
When hed arrI'ved at a bend in
The captain will be here soon.
He looked at Reynie inchagrin.
I only knowChopsticks, anyway.
We go right, he said, finally.
The witches will be here soon.
Curtiss chin began to quI'ver.
My father lives at Rodrubn; my
give me your radio, Crawlings.
Thatsthe only possible answer!
give us another Outsider song!
You dont understand, I insist.
Then I've failed, he muttered.
And no one ever looked at him.
Artemis felt suddenly nervous.
Brendan looked at her askance.
Brendan looked at him blankly.
I see sunlight poking through.
That will be all, Jillson, Mr.
Finally, whinnied the centaur.
The rI'ver remained covered in
Did I see Nicoles toes wiggle?
Yes, I've heard all about him.
Prue paused and looked around.
She had arrI'ved at the bluff.
Do forgive the noise, it said.
Suddenly, the trees came alive.
They will pay with their lives.
new one will be far, far worse.
I know I've been very busy, but
I have a lot ofmail to deliver.
That stuff gives me the creeps.
I gave Nicole a nervous glance.
But the perspectives a bit off.
This place gives me the spooks.
For a while, they looked at it.
It is time for decisive action.
No1 rubbed his palms nervously.
Finally, hetugged Stanleys ear.
Reynie looked at her curiously.
Of course I've been keeping up!
They all looked at one another.
I see things, suspect everyone.
what looked to be a great hall.
He never stops taking pictures.
Richter said they live far away
Curtain, finally understanding.
I never want to see snow again.
I never noticed a label before.
He will be received with honor.
I must give her my condolences.
My brother, just five days ago 
She looked ready to be furious.
The dogs refused to go farther.
Finally I can test my theories.
She looked over and saw no one.
Finally, Cooper made a mistake.
The consequences will be swift.
A minute later she joined them.
How did you get in here anyway?
Cmon and give your Mary a hint!
He looked well fed, not fierce.
Now give your poor tutor a hug.
I understand, she said quietly.
I swam in the rI'ver, she said.
Idont understand why he did it.
As Lyra looked at her, she had 
Anyway, Ive been doing Pilates.
Why didnt I think this through?
It was only a nervous response.
I've leapt farther in my sleep!
Why are boys so special anyway?
Wouldnt you want to live there?
Anyway,lets get this over with.
Whywould he give us fake money?
Until finally they had an idea.
Why have you not destroyed her?
Alexandra looked on and smiled.
Artemis glanced down nervously.
Alarmed, Prue looked at Curtis.
And she wouldnt last five days.
Just a little misunderstanding.
What is Milligan doing, anyway?
Anyway, no need to go that far.
You wont believe what happened.
Twenty-five years, said Cooper.
Anyway, my names not Bloomburg.
You dont want me along, anyway.
We move, said Brendan, finally.
I've seen pipes in the kitchen.
The next one was this: Success!
Who said you could give orders?
I've often wondered that myself.
Kate looked hopefully at Reynie.
Anyway, there are complications.
So how do we find the next clue?
I mean I've read aboutit before.
They want to kill us all anyway.
Smart Girl looked at Scurvy Sam.
Anyway, to answer your question.
Do you know something, Bertholt?
Sir,Buttons knows what happened.
Cmere and look what I've caught.
How long before the rest of them
The other children looked at Mr.
THE Olive TREE AND THE FIG TREE 
When Reynie looked doubtful, Mr.
Not like any key I've ever seen.
The Ten Man looked disappointed.
Each cluell lead ye to the next.
I've never had the nerve to ask.
We wont survI'velike the ghosts?
Sticky looked in all directions.
I want to live with you forever.
I think he has magic of his own.
Dont be nervous, laughed Vilyak.
I think my skins changed colour.
I think of everything, do I not?
I think its best if we split up.
What happened to all the people?
They get to live on through you!
This is thestrongest I've found.
I never got a Candy-Gram before.
I came from the rI'ver, from St.
I bet hell be able to understand
I lived with him for four years,
It worked, gasped Holly finally.
And when she looked through it .
He stood and looked behind them.
Coulter looked at him curiously.
Hey, this is an impressiveglobe.
You cant still be hungry, Ardle.
Peoples lives were at stakehere.
I've never heard of one of them.
I've been making perfect scores.
I think we dont bother knocking.
You did tag me, he said finally.
as he intended to escape anyway.
Prue looked back at her blankly.
I see a flash of the babys eyes.
We can revisit that issue later.
Well, understand this, stranger.
Number Two, engage the Receiver.
Vishby seemed even more nervous.
Finally, Seamus hazarded a word.
Just how long have we been away?
Its like seventy-five feet tall.
I was a shaman when I was alive.
Holly fixed up your ribs, I see.
Anyway, he hated to disturb her.
She looked at the seedpod again.
The distance of about fivetrees.
I see, said his servant quietly.
He looked up at Prue sheepishly.
And I think it wants its mother.
He said he begs yourforgiveness.
Im hoping for later, Neldo said.
Finally, Carl broke the silence.
that they never healed properly.
But I decided to come in anyway.
I think you may have a condition.
Well, anyway, so I thought, but .
The happiest I've ever been in my
The way I see it, Mulch, he said.
I was to give you this, she said.
I dont know what happened, Moose.
The others will be with you soon.
The reporter swallowed nervously.
I've already located what I seek.
I dont see them, he said finally.
There he clung and looked around.
Nicole asked, Then what happened?
Theirs wasthe only road in sight.
Dressed in expensive clothes, and
I cant give the Book to Astaroth!
Do you live under the back porch?
The moment had arrI'ved too soon!
I used to know you, but somehow I
Did you see what happened, missy?
Did you say they never came back?
Do you know how to use a compass,
We live and die and that is that.
He looked atAlexandra pleadingly.
He looked hungry and oldand sad .
She had set her alarm for five a.
He looked up at Prue quizzically.
Sarah looked long and hard at the
He looked to the others for help.
She looked down at him and cooed.
She heard their furtive whispers.
Holly was understandably dubious.
Whose lives did the captain mean?
You probably couldnt help anyway.
You are attentive children, then!
Principal Guiney will understand.
Hes like the brother I never had.
Im of no use to you if Im asleep.
Or maybe its time thatsdeceptive.
Ill be out of your way in a tick.
With luck well still be in range.
Wouldnt he be certain to give up?
Reynie looked down from his bunk.
Rasmussen with a dismissive wave.
Is that the only idea You've had?
Ill look at it later, shemumbled.
The Executives run the show here.
What happened to the other three?
I think thats worth a few bars of
What in the world was I thinking?
I think the muumuu is giving me a
The drI'ver glanced at the Agent.
Maxs father listened attentively,
Wellyou know Finally, he gave up.
The children lookedquickly about.
I think we have a situation here.
Anyway, what good would a lookdo?
So he has to give me some of his.
Ill even give you a tip for free.
She would face the remorse later.
He gives nothing freely, said Ms.
Honey, I think its better if you 
First of all, what happened here?
Forgive me for asking this, Miss.
Jump down and give Kate a chance.
Sticky looked suddenly regretful.
It wasnormal to feel nervous, Mr.
Thats the part I dont understand.
Can you give me a boost up there?
I've killed enough living things.
Youve had a talk with him, I see.
I've been thereto the banditcamp.
I've never been woken so quietly.
I've been thinking about what Mr.
give me the key to the handcuffs.
I've got nothing to draw it with.
I've had lots of meetings lately.
But to this he received no reply.
Actually, Will felt very nervous.
Constance looked faintly hopeful.
She lives right on the edge of the
I feel like I swallowed a beehive.
We lost five men and one gyropter.
It looks like  Finally it hit him.
, do you know anything about this?
It was dishonorable to deceive us.
I seem to run into a lot of those.
Not at all, sir, said the drI'ver.
Kate, we live in the Cenozoic Era.
You nervous about school starting?
I've been thinking about upstairs.
Nor is it exclusive of friendship.
Havent given it that much thought.
He looked over at Prue and smiled.
The adhesive property of thoughts.
Nicely done, said Foaly nervously.
A moment later there was the muted
I shall keep you now I've got you.

Finally, Rawley settled them down.

How much do you know about demons?
But in a dumb waythats my opinion.
This will be ourlast interruption.
The answer, I think, isclearly no.
But Fate does iron wedges drI've, 
Show them your Receiver gizmo, Mr.
what I think it means, eh, Jayjay?
Here is the situation as I see it.
Its the only thing I can think of.
I've seen those, too, Fredle said.
Curtain quI'vered with irritation.
and Im not brave, not very anyway.
Ian gasped, finally understanding.
I think I may have started atrend.
It is against policy, and anyway .
Finally, the hole was deep enough.
I think he wont try anything here.
Wait  you think Milligan is alive?
What have you got to bargain with?
Thats where Ill be if you need me.
I think we need to try to find it.
Being that house mice live inside.
Yes, I think I would be satisfied.
Vishby was nervous, and it showed.
Well, this is what I think of you.
Thats what I've got the knife for.
looked one more time upon Rodrubn.
We give them everything we've got.
Alexandra looked at her guardedly.
A minute later she had the answer.
Do you have any strange relatives?
Benedict looked at Reynie askance.
Milligan looked sadly at Constance.
I know, I've often thought of that.
Benedict felt very far away indeed.
Whats so great about Pluto, anyway?
Anyway, the park is closed downnow.
I think so, answered the commander.
But go ahead: Spit your invectives.
Yes, she has, said Max defensively.
Well, I've got to go home, he said.
Its t-true, stammered Prue finally.
They still disliked the Executives.
I've never heard of a such a thing.
For live, spelled backward, isEVIL.
Its a good place to begin, I think.
He cut swiftly, and looked up: that
I understand your suspicion, Holly.
And I think it might hold the Star.
That bridge has claimed many lives.
Seconds later, he felt his questing
She looked up at the children, then
And how long has she had this gift?
I think youre talking through your 
You are the first to begiven a key.
Can you just give it in a nutshell?
It will be a dark night, said Kate.
He proceeded to give Curtis a quick
He looked wildly from face to face.
Its a trick, he pronounced finally.
Everyone in the room looked at him.
keep you alive; now may we move on?
Vye after vye fell to Maxs knI'ves.
I know that, but you looked grayer.
give him a minute and hell tell us.
What are you talking about, anyway?
And whens Scout coming back anyway?
Balthamos looked back, in surprise.
You both know curiosity will drI've
I've got a sling, suggested Curtis.
Weird spellsprimitivetattooed right
Well, You've arrI'ved just in time.
Except I know she will be one day .
I cant give Nick up to thesepeople.
Ill be sure the others follow suit.
You know we cant understand French.
He seemed finally to be recovering.
The other children looked relieved.
I received a visitor, she murmured.
The warden finally realized what my
I think they really liked you best.
What happened to give you the sraf?
Woo-Hah was the only answer he got.
We have to live in our own worlds .
Why dont field mice live in fields?
I've never seenanyone move so fast.
and anyway, Nicole is wearing hers.
What happened to being an inventor?
Theres no way that woman survI'ved.
In Thernbaakagen, they hadarrI'ved.
A truculent gnome refused to yield.
Martina had been made an Executive.
Ithought you were an Executive now.
Martina looked at him suspiciously.
Youre going to wish you didnt live!
Thats what I think, Annie declares.
To his representative, said Tialys.
Then, one day, it finally happened.
I hope youhavent given up on the S.
How long if you had some incentive?
Of course you dont understand, lad!
We are leaving in fiveminutes time.
Am I seeing what I think Im seeing?
He looked around at the Rowdy Boys.
He stopped and looked down at Prue.
The Governess looked at her fondly.
They wont let you in there, anyway.
They would have to try again later.
You have ingested an explosive, Mr.
The children looked at one another.
used to say: Trust the hair, Mulch.
Brendan received the news silently.
Did he escape to come live with us?
Theres not so much to tell, anyway.
I've hidden us, said David wearily.
I've brought you some soap, Sticky.
Come on, mate, urged Carl nervously.
Hell never know what happened to us.
She looked solemnly at the children.
We can have the crystal reset later.
He wasnt used to explaining himself.
Ill be all rightdont worry about me.
tripped over the bears massive paws.
I see youbrought quite a few guests.
Im honored to finally meet you and I
Jaaved suddenly seemedto understand.
Lyra looked at Will and saw him nod.
How long have you been spying on me?
The doctors could not understand it.
What kind of a friend is he, anyway?
I live down in the Workers District.
Not even asecond later, Iggy landed.
Prue shyly looked down at her shoes.
Oh, very good, he responded finally.
No1 felt his tail vibrate nervously.
And the reason I've come is because 
Sprites hover when they are nervous.
Its okay, Kate had said tentatively.
There used to be eleven, said Mulch.
I think itdgive even ol Kraken fits.
Meanwhile, I've sent for some juice.
Finally he askedher what it was for.
When you get older youll understand.
I've told you never to call me that!
He nodded and looked down at Curtis.
Its light, but youll get used to it.
Sterling looked at him suspiciously.
We both know that, but I ask anyway.
The others looked ather in surprise.
Someone with access to the Archives!
In due time, all will be made clear.
Someone had to deliverit, after all.
I dont understand it, muttered Root.
Itsthe only way I can keep you safe.
I felt so awful about what happened.
I've never known the fire to be out.
I've been instructed to tell you so.
I never would have shot you, Butler.
He had finally managed to calm down.
What happened to your shield, Short?
It hadseemed impressive at the time.
Foaly could guess what would happen.
This isnt the place to do it,anyway.
Two frogs lived together in a marsh.
He awoke minutes later only to laugh
lively bunch, he said under the din.
I think they was fighting over this.
Howd you get the name Stink, anyway?
I've got a couple more things to do.
Its getting late anyway, almost day.
I think this merits more than a wow.
I've had enough of yourdistractions.
We hope you will be able to help us.
You just earned five pieces o eight!
I think Theresa gave him something .
Nanotechnology, replied the drI'ver.
Finally they reached a little wooden
He didnt care much for magic anyway.
Milligan looked away over the water.
But I think someone is following us.
The next step also calls for gifts  
The child must be given as offering.
Juliet studied the system nervously.
Holly could guess what would happen.
Until I was made Executive, that is.
I think we can say youre in contact.
Well, I think I know whereshe lives.
The discomfort will be over shortly.
The children instinctively recoiled.
Maybe raccoons had lived in the wild
Im even getting used to this squeaky
Care to hazard a guess what they are?
That sounds like a wonderful journey.
Reynie nodded, finally understanding.
Finally the golden monkey joined Mrs.
I've made my decision, Milligan said.
Are you ready to begin the next test?
Finally the container stopped moving.
As the children looked up, sheltering
Maybe the next ones a map, Kate said.
Constance looked exceedingly pleased.
I see, said Butler and Root together.
Just give up and take an easier path.
Finally she sat up and looked around.
Stink told Mom and Dad what happened.
How many people live in the Workshop?
All right, he said once hed arrI'ved.
What is THAT I see climbing on board?
And Ill give the briefcase back, too.
He wanted to give her another chance.
In the Archives, replied Max heavily.
And yet if the Shortcut arrI'ves late
Rasmussen looked genuinely perplexed.
The child looked at Curtis and cooed.
I think they think theyre anarchists.
I think we have something I think its
Maybe I could live with the gyptians.
Maxs head swI'veled up and he gasped.
Buttons, please, you must understand.
The trainingknI'ves are all I've got.
Never mind, well talk about it later.
I think he bought it, replied Butler.
I didnt, of course, as I've told you.
Well explain later, Reynie whispered.
She looked extraordinarily impressed.
I've a mind to set some things right.
Ill be fine, replied the stoic Agent.
So, the Mud Boy understands Gnommish.
You, my boy, strI've to be as good as
But I think I know someone who could.
Anyway, do I look like a fern type of
I've seen that before, whispered Max.
Do you remember what happened to him?
press buttons, not to offer opinions.
I've got my ways, said David lightly.
Things can finally go back to normal.
Kate looked wonderingly at Constance.
Who knows what the next month brings?
He looked up when he sawCurtis enter.
He looked up at the gathered bandits.
Dont give up the ship now, said Judy.
I think about how much I hate Trixle.
The others looked at him expectantly.
It was almost as if he never existed.
Plus I think he was reading it wrong.
I think Im entitled to a little moan.
They stalked me down and let me live.
And just how do you know all of this?
But Max is the only onewho survI'ved.
He looked almost as if he were drunk,
Why do they say it like that, anyway?
Youre an attentive listener, said Mr.
Or at least this used to be the case.
I dont like em, said Lyra decisively.
He looked over at Kate and Constance.
Half a minute later, the door opened.
I've aced every assignment this year!
I've already made other arrangements.
Curtain is the big deceiver, remember?
Seconds later, she disappeared inside.
Itembarrasses me to be so ineffective.
Finally, the group reached the summit.
Whatchoo thinking about, anyway, love?
The others looked expectantly at Kate.
Reynie bit his tongue and looked away.
Panting, Max turned and looked at Bob.
But things will be better for you now,
He looked like a red-headed crocodile.
I think the guilt is the main problem.
I dont know, Curtis, she said finally.
I've heard of that place, Reynie said.
How long do you think youve been here?
And a few moments latercame the sound.
He looked super-shrimpy, and wide as a
Anyway, even if we could, as you know,
Holly finally risked an upward glance.
I dont suppose I've got a home anyway.
She looked at Reynie withworried eyes.
Nobody gives away food, Axle told him.
I never thought to check them earlier.
Then he looked at Kate and Sticky, who
What you kids doin on this run anyway?
You saw what happened with the skewer.
Anyway, Im going straight from now on.
Thats a lot of cash, said Pex finally.
We checked your e-mail and guess what?
She looked at him, struck by the idea.
Why are you going to Portugal, anyway?
Thats not the only way to be grown-up.
So I've got to put her out of my mind.
The lymrill sniffed at it tentatively.
You will be under my complete control!
Pushing it would admit the Executives.
Finally the coast loomed ahead of her.
Constance looked positively disgusted.
Sir, Commander, we know what happened.
Andbesides, I think we will be needed.
I think fifteen minutesshould be fine.
Four hundred, said Prue, give or take.
So, what happened with your interview?
How do you know there is such a thing?
Its the only one right here right now.
Stink looked up, down, and all around.
No thoughtless slumberings did divert 
Rowan had become a beehive ofactivity.
Satisfied, she looked back at Brendan.
Mum blushed and smiled appreciatively.
Constance looked at him incredulously.
Moose, you understand, Scout whispers.
The drI'ver swallowed hard and nodded.
I mean Oh, gods, I think I kissed you.
I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.
Reynie waited forher to give her name.
Well, what would the next age be like?
Dont give them any excuse to hurt you.
Fredle stood struck still, and looked.
It used to belong to a curry smuggler.
The only sound was the gentle, endless
Do you know anything about the couple?
Used to belong to some movie director.
He turned to the slightly nervous imp.
Kate looked very uncomfortable indeed.
And how do you know that, Master Wigby?
He looked after us, you know, said Max.
It was given to me, replied Max coldly.
His brain had finally placed the scent.
I've never actually been to the cellar.
Spies will be looking for us in Lisbon.
I've got to go back and look after her.
Arriving at Brendans feet, he shivered.
I see, said No1, not convincing anyone.
Also, I've been wanting to measure you.
He never said anything aboutthis place.
They were all nervous and apprehensive.
Annie, you stay put, you understand me?
And anyway, I dont think our neighbours
better off as a mindless lapdog anyway.
Theyre not home anyway, Jimmy declares.
Its inhabitants will be most delighted.
That is a problem well deal with later.
the only possible entrance to upstairs.
How long have you known me, Number One?
They will be here in another day or so.
She looked more decisive than she felt.
That little misunderstanding last year.
Why dont you give us some food and tell
But what happened when we touched them?
And a moment later the angel would have
Though as I've previously remarked, Mr.
Will got to his feet and looked around.
Anyway, yes, we've heard about the spy.
Now go your ways, hunt, feed, and live.
Scalene went in, but he never came out.
What was Verbil doing out there anyway?
I see, she said with a suspicious look.
So I looked around for a heating vent  
Benedict looked somewhat uncomfortable.
Reynie looked anxiously at his friends.
Finally, he had the purchase he needed.
I've discovered somethingsomething very
A bent, cloaked drI'ver held the reins.
I can understand everything youve said.
Benedict looked frankly at his brother.
Your sleek coatshows how well you live.
Well come to your world and live there!
I've had enough of witches for one day.
We should all get some sleep, she said.
It was difficult at first to gather the
Enough was finally enough, so No1 broke
Benedicts live violet,required no care.
It was theonly way to cross the rI'ver.
And to live and die by the bandit band.
asked Juliet, understandably concerned.
Were you the only one who passed, then?
If you need anything, ask an Executive.
just an order for shuttle parts anyway.
I've grown up and you should have, too.
Okay, said Prue, finally, I understand.
Benedict give the information outright?
If youre so nervous, you can wait here.
I've had the same feeling, Reynie said.
Rest assured, theywill be looked after.
Hurt anyway they can, anyone, anywhere.
Reynie and Sticky looked at each other.
And I know a donkey when I see one too.
The prince of the angels looked at her.
I've read that imps are shape-shifters.
The others must still be on the island!
Brendan looked him squarely in the eye.
I think the word is mnemonic, said Dad.
I never saw a dwarf pay for a meal yet.
Heflung open the panes and looked down.
are a lot smarter than they used to be.
sometimes I think you dont have a spine.
How do you know I wont double-cross you?
Its the only way I want to know, Fredle.
Sticky looked doubtful, even suspicious.
Curtis looked at Prue, his face falling.
Lord Astaroth will be most disappointed.
She hoped she hadnt given too much away.
I've even made friends with the Old Hag.
The entire world was aliveand conscious.
The eagle finally broke his steady gaze.
On all of the databases, you understand?
There was no boy, said the chef finally.
Anyway, I bet theyre cleverer than that.
He paused to study the nearest specimen.
The dogs barked and skittered nervously.
I think we should book passage to Spain.
What clothes could an angel wear anyway?
Finally Will said, Balthamos, come here.
Minutes to see some old dirty Executive.
Yeah, I think maybe my house is on fire!
Alexandra smiled and looked back at him.
Was the pressure finally getting to him?
Then will be the time for you to eat me.
Mum looked near tears but managed a nod.
Ill summon myExecutives to bear you off.
Mary looked at her friend in puzzlement.
The ox looked surprised at the question.
I think he dropped something, said Judy.
A hypocrite deceives no one but himself.
Please drI've across to the island gate.
Please remain calm, replied the drI'ver.
Hollyhad never been a career elf anyway.
Ill bet youanything the next line of Mr.
No call was issued, no signal given, but
Its really a one-girl operation, anyway.
So what does duskwort look like, anyway?
Sadie lifted her head and looked around.
So we went outto give em a little taste.
Who wants to have to live off rainwater?
Ill be givin ye yer first piece o eight.
Anyway, you know how the Bwa Kell works.
I dont know if I like the place, anyway.
Youre Max McDaniels, he said decisively.
She looked back to remind him of it now.
Captain Nolands already given the order.
Our lives will be different for a while.
He had yet to meet an Executive, though.
THIRTY-five OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY 
Howd you come here if youre still alive?
Remember: Our very lives depend on this.
He started, then looked up into the sky.
That was someentrance, she said finally.
A few minutes later, I heard Dads voice.
And I think that it belongs to thechild.
Not tomention the only one in the house.
Joe practically had a nervous breakdown.
Im sure your little raptor will be fine.
How long since you completed the Ritual?
I see youve gotten yourself a new cloak.
Unfortunately, I have none to give them.
Thats the coolest thing I've ever heard!
But this is the farthest I've ever gone,
Finally, the penny drops, thought Holly.
give me the tea, sir, Ill bring it to the
All reserved for the exclusive use of our
What genius designed this system, anyway?
How long will it take to weave the spell?
Even millions, Sticky said with a shiver.
I do have quite a bit of mail to deliver.
I seem to be bigger than you, Miss Koboi.
Not after what happened to Retrieval One.
What happened back then  eight years ago?
Curtain will be watching everybody very .
Well, from what I've seen , Reynie began.
give me the keys and tell me where to go.
If youre right there, why cant I see you?
Youll just have to explain what happened.
A minute later, he swiveled to face Root.
And now its safe, or it will be when the 
Moments later the two of them were in Mr.
Im going to have to be aggressive, I see.
How long before were in detonation range?
Max nodded but looked warily behind them.
Nevertheless, they looked as if they did.
I want to talk to Foaly, he said finally.
But the only thing he could do was go on.
The air was cool; fall had trulyarrI'ved.
If this bike gives out on me, Im screwed.
How long until we reach his grandfathers?
The others fell silent and looked at him.
It mightnt take, muttered Root nervously.
If not, I cannot see howwe will survI've.
Anyway, since Im awake Im going to do it.
She put them together and looked through.
Anyway, the gargoyles touch only works on
Curtis paused and looked over at the rat.
King Kong was only twenty-five feet tall.
one of the big cats got a little nervous.
Im suresomeone will be along to help you.
Thats not a real convict baseball anyway.
You understand that you must get a signed
Benedict would give him more money later.
Dutifully the children looked and nodded.
Thats the Executives coming up the steps.
I've come toshow you to the Waiting Room.
Prue and her mother looked on helplessly.
Sticky looked at his parents in surprise.
How do you know thats where the beast is?
Finally Neldo asked, How did you do that?
I see what you are trying to say, Juliet.
give assistance, not advice, in a crisis.
Remember what happened with me and Rocky?
Its understandable, noted the manservant.
And anyway, we have no option but to try.
Its mostly a title I use to scare people.
According to Butler, you used to be a bit
And anyway, its better that hes not here.
How do you know it belonged to my mother?
Not the warlocks though, they never warp.
But it was the only way to keep her safe!
Because youre the only one who can do it.
Now give us the details, and do it quick.
Remind me to tell you later, Reynie said.
It is very doubtful that Ill be able to .
His eyes looked from side to side, to see
I must say shes given usall quite a turn.
And I think Opal Koboi might notice them.
Balthamos looked at Baruch, who shrugged.
You will never earn a name from the book.
I think little Descant has a crush on me.
What could he do, anyway, about anything?
looked back at once, fully focused on him.
whole thing was a mistake, I see that now.
because they were going to save our lives.
He laid down his pencil and looked around.
Alexandra stopped and looked over at Prue.
It looked and smelled to Mary likean acid.
Holly Short had finally arrested Turnball.
It looked strange and awkward inher hands.
Impressive, said Connor, wiping his mouth.
They looked tense and driven with purpose.
Only a few seconds later she had vanished.
I think the question here is, who are you?
I couldnt give you this earlier, she said.
Im told objectives are revealed as you go.
pinches when I see how expensive they are.
Seems to think hes the only one capable of
I've often been able to sense such things.
Rasmussen, swI'veling to face themonitors.
She looked like she wanted to throttle us.
I think theres a spark of hope in you yet.
At first it looked like a motorcycle gang.
The vendor looked at Kate, then at Sticky.
I think my pelvis is broken, she realized.
That will probably come later, he decided.
It did no good to argue with an Executive.
She looked down modestly and said nothing.
For sure and absolute positive, said Judy.
At last I can finally fly again, Turnball.
But they found me, she said with a shiver.
I feel bad for her, said David decisively.
Computer stuff, you wouldnt understand it.
The others looked at one another, stymied.
Their hard work paid off the next morning.
Pan will be glad one day, too, when I die.
Brendan was the first to give the command.
She looked around again at all the people.
He looked at each of the children in turn.
Pedalian looked down upon them dejectedly.
You lot live on the fourth floor, dontcha?
I've been a bad influence on that one, he 
He looked in the first and found it empty.
Apparently itpreferred Stickys given name.
Wellcall her down later, if you dont mind.
Max glanced about the old house nervously.
five minutes, said Max, watching the hill.
Which makes thembetter Executive material.
I see that Button Benttail is at it again.
Okay, I understand that with Scout, maybe.
Hidden behind those reflective lenses, Mr.
The eagle snorted and looked back at Prue.
They got out of the car and looked around.
But I seem to be missing a few key pieces.
what happened next, happened very quickly.
Rasmussen described him, said the drI'ver.
Kate and Reynie looked at him in surprise.
It finally makes sense to me, Reynie said.
Youstay here, and Ill be back in a minute.
of them  hed assumed they were decorative.
Just wanted to give you a fighting chance!
It will be rough, but you can handle them.
Curtainflipped to the next dog-eared page.
It will be a dark day, said Reynie grimly.
He paid the drI'ver and asked him to wait.
I think of it as redistribution of wealth.
he asked, unable to mask a nervous tremor.
Anyway, Sticky said, were glad youre here.
They revised this opinion when the van was
Anyway, Trixle said you have to go, Scout.
Hes in the gym, I think, on the treadmill.
Probably would have made a good Executive.
Now we have waited for thirty consecutive 
Finally, he knew his place in theuniverse.
Several hours later, Miss Boon was furious.
Anyway I want you on monitors,just in case.
I wonder what happened to Jaaved, she said.
I just wanted to surprise you, I tell them.
I think I know how to get you out of there.
Who should arrI've at the top of the heath?
He looked likehe was tending an eye injury.
The Authority will be powerless after this.
Unfortunately, I've not entirely succeeded.
Looks like the law finally tracked us down.
Ill try to come to your nest, later, after.
And it was the only dessert we had all day!
Im afraid the next part is a bit technical.
Its not safe for a mouse to be near humans.
None of the Rowan representatives answered.
There will be no travel outside it anymore.
No one was prepared for what happened next.
No answer was given; the man simply stared.
Coulter looked uncannily like her daughter.
Iphigenia, her face set, looked at the fox.
Thats when I think me some thoughts of you.
five minutes later they were lost to sight.
That gives me nine hours, said Agent Lorca.
So am I to understand that Theo is correct?
Eventually Opal refused to  see him at all.
It depends on how long it takes me to cover
And the only blood that ivyll be feeding on
While he was chewing, Fredle looked around.
Anyway, this must be the world of the dead.
Very well, Ill be right there, Rhonda said.
Even if he would still be absolutely alone.
Lets not give away all our ideas, said Mrs.
Sticky told him, and Reynie looked at Kate.
Hes one ofthe only pirates with a red flag.
George was glad to finally find his friend.
I have no idea how long well be underwater.
From the distance, it was difficult to make
himself in a language Ian didnt understand.
Its the only thing that happens here in the
I agree, said David, shivering in the wind.
And anyway, Artemis wasnt just a principal.
And, unlike my fickle brethren, I've stayed
What do the Executives do in there, anyway?
I see her so often, she might as well be my
I can guess what you were about to say, Mr.
The Recruiter looked on the verge of tears.
Look how long it took to shut down Napster.
Instinctively, Max reached out to catch it.
Finally she sat up and tried to take stock.
As terrible as that soundsits all clearnow.
Thatgives me hope, and hope keeps me going.
What have you done to my thoughts, Artemis?
They will be here not long after nightfall.
with my dad, as if her opinion isnt enough.
I dont have to tell you what happened next.
Nah, said Bellagrog with a dismissive wave.
I see, said Butler and Root simultaneously.
I think someone has an inferiority complex.
He paused to butter another slice of bread.
We wont ever use names, and will never give
Welive together in kindness and friendship.
What it looked like he did was step forward
It wasnt the humidity, he was used to that.
He looked up, bemused, nervous, and nodded.
moments later he was in the e-mail program.
A second later the knife was in his breast.
He doubted hed be able to eat much, anyway.
What I've read explains a lot, Sticky said.
Its only to meet this headmistress, anyway.
Obediently the children looked at the floor.
I've heard of her, he said, glancing at Max.
No, interjected Astaroth, she is alive, Max.
I have no real name, because I never warped.
But the answer remained maddeningly elusive.
I have no doubt he will be looking for them.
Our most generous estimates give you a year.
But they might still be after you, she said.
the only way you can see the jumbled-up map.
Prue stiffened and looked over her shoulder.
unpleasantness and simply deliver you to Mr.
until June got home I will never understand.
Hearing the door open, he briefly looked up.
It was next to useless at that range anyway.
Do you remember what happened to my brother?
What elsecan there be to live on after that?
I think we can live through one afternoon in
Both dmons looked at Will, and at the knife.
To their surprise, Milligan looked relieved.
Four hours later she was very hot and tired.
I think I should get back to HQ, said Holly.
Finally the professional got the upper hand.
I I just wanted to thank you, Jul Commander.
Captain Noland looked up and down the table.
Anyway, what wouldyou do with one in prison?
Now at last I will fly where I never thought
I felt as if something they all passionately
That explains why the fears come back later.
Jaaved can understand and speak English with
The young man looked back at his passengers.
As he swI'veled his head about in a panic, a
Finally, she hissed, Well, dont go that way!
olives  theres something called whoopie pie.
I've got bacon on, darling, said her mother,
The wood grew darker, the canopy oppressive.
Thats impressive sleight of hand, my friend.
I've often wondered about that, said Reynie.
Which brings me to why I've called you here.
The girl looked up at him with hopeful eyes.
Are you going to take Max into the Archives?
I think you got another problem here, Moose.
A second later, Mum nearly tackled the pair.
The second unit is to capture the boy alive.
The more opinions we can call on the better.
Because Ill be difficult, said David simply.
Stop looking for gloryand give us the story!
The only footprints we've seen belong to Mr.
Theo asked, seeming not quite to understand.
Anyway, you didnthave to deal with Milligan.
The next train leaves for Bilbao in an hour.
Coulter looked around, alive with curiosity.
She could not understand what was happening.
sputtered when he was finally able to speak.
Sticky, already beaming, now positivelyshone.
I was there when the instructions were given.
Richter lookedweak; Connor looked near death.
His entire head quI'vered like a struck bell.
I was taking their opinions under advisement.
I didnt give them the message about the wind.
Helooked at his untouched meal with distaste.
I think it was all an accident, she confides.
I love being alive, and I love my dmon, and .
Richter placed a protective arm around David.
I think its mine, said Artemis automatically.
No wonder you are such a unI'versal favorite.
I believe we shall receive special attention.
I cant remember half of the words I've heard.
Rasmussen with a dismissive air of authority.
Rasmussen with a dismissive wave of his hand.
No one was more focused on our objective than
Ama looked at the figure in the sleeping bag.
And still wearing the old LEP uniform, I see.
Me, Ill be court-martialed if Im ever caught!
Benedict, with exceptionally sensitive minds.
Prues gone homeshes given up, for all I know.
Everyone was happy to finally find the puppy.
Lets not quibble over administrative details.
Reynie looked down at his outfit in surprise.
And when I get nervous I tend to fire people.
give them back, Max whispered, half pleading.
And finally, said Father MacPhail, the child.
And afterward hed give the kids ginger snaps.
Finally they came close again, and he heard: 
Finally they were looking at Barcelona again.
Really, I've never felt so cranky in my life.
And I was hoping Scouts opinion of me would .
The children looked at one another, appalled.
Im not used to taking care of a newborn, Mrs.
They whisked him away to active service after
I never tell anybody exactly how clever I am.
I never asked you for  His voice trailed off.
He had caught the scent of expensive cologne.
Her mouth was dry; it was difficult to speak.
Anyway, I dont know how to answer this thing.
In his letter Curtain saidhe was positive Mr.
I think Artemis Fowl crashedGoogle and Yahoo.
Others in the group looked at the mother with
He looked about him at the rest of the group.
I've been away a lot longer than three weeks.
No, just the tall one, said Mum conclusively.
But when he looked for it later, it was gone.
The place looked like a carnival set upon the
I've never seen anyone so smart with a clip  
You saw the crowd, said Sterling defensively.
Therefore, we must see it through to the end.
Thing is, I've a customer whos expecting that
He looked up at Prue, hiseyes wet with tears.
MY father had finally regained consciousness.
Obviously the aunt changed the spellinglater.
He had not shaved for days and looked a mess.
I wish I could understand, said No1, shaking.
I think I know where the beast may be hiding.
I wish I had another honey bread to give you.
I've never hated you, but I could understand .
Finally there was something Fredle knew about.
He looked down the line at Constance and Kate.
I never have to think about anyone but myself.
I used to think he had a zoom lens for a nose!
No, said Lyra, except that it was by a rI'ver.
The others looked at one another in disbelief.
twigs and grass theyd used to cover the relic.
You need to understand a few things, Paradizo.
Even though the next morning he would leave on
Septimus, nonplussed, looked at the whetstone.
Reynie and Sticky looked at each other in awe.
The intrusive imp was not nearly quick enough.
I think I've been as foolish as IofurRakinson.
He looked back at Prue,smiling apologetically.
I think what Brother has is the teasing virus.
I think you might want to talk to this person.
He looked at Prue mournfully and repeated, Ow.
I just need a moment more and Ill be on myway.
I lived with someonenot Alfredo, someone else.
You must read more than anybody I've ever met.
Remember that phrase we heard on the Receiver?
I bet they never saw anything like thatbefore.
Kate cried, crouching into a defensive stance.
I think we need to take a step back from this.
I havent had a chance to give it much thought.
The others looked at one another in confusion.
He looked back at Prue with a sidelong glance.
I think I saw this place in a Bond movie once.
Imfairly certain shes alive  I saw her twitch.
The others looked at one another in amazement.
About his Whisperer being a sensitive machine?
They are less war like and more understanding.
Ians feet finally agreed to moveand move fast.
I know how it sounds, but thats what happened.
I see, muttered Rootwhich was basically a lie.
But what is this trip you wish to make,anyway?
Iphigenia gripped Prues arm and looked at her.
Milligan looked grim, even more so than usual.
She looked up to see him pop itinto his mouth.
I think she was caught off-guard by the jungle
Thank god Kraken arrI'ved to put an end to it!
If we deceived you, it was necessary, he said.
myself with Scout here getting nervous for me.
Oh, I see, youre checking my mental faculties.
How could you possibly understandthese things?
The vent was too tiny to climb through,anyway.
Apparently several live exhibits have escaped,
But the answers we need arent in the Archives.
His eyes squint with the effort to understand.
When the gales had finally subsided, he shook 
Artemis voiced the opinion that they all held.
Says Sawyer, Ill give you a piece of the deal 
I think he likes them better than he likes us.
Had the Executives come to break down thedoor?
I think there is, argued ten-year-old Artemis.
It isnt that unusual, Sticky said defensively.
Do you know what a sensation that will create?
Finally, they were looking at Barcelona again.
I think some of my best work will be in banks.
I think the barking dog scared him, I replied.
This starboard booster used to be in E1, until
I've got a hold, rat, dont worry, said Seamus.
I think we have a moment or two, said Artemis.
Cooper stood by the door and looked them over.
Holly tried to smile, but she was too nervous.
Kate looked longingly back toward the shelter.
Anyway, shouldnt he be glad the captain cared?
You should have done that when you were alive.
To think that so many people will be so happy!
Im so sorry I dont have any treat to give you.
What that mouse didnt look was at all nervous.
Thanks anyway, the man said, shaking his head.
The shape of the hourglass looked like a big X.
I hope she stays alive as long as ever she can.
You know, I think my eyeshadow distracted them.
I wanted to give you keepsakes as an expression
It seemed to her that Milligan had overlooked a
Pressius for decoys to give to all four of you.
But theGallivespians brought them a file, and .
I couldnt live anywhere as dangerous as inside.
I want to give you something, he said abruptly.
Did she understand why Piper was yelling at me?
Thescholarship to study them is alive and well.
he asked, and Ian knew he was nervous about the
Not a mouse, because mice didnt give food away.
But Ill tell you more about him later, he said.
I've a widow in South Wood whos lost an appeal.
Something was bound to happen, sooner or later.
Given the number of Messengers, our turn should
No-Name looked at her sisters, and they nodded.
Soon, dark nasties will be digginginto cellars.
You mean you live in this house and dont even ?
They stopped and looked around, seeing nothing.
Anyway, youll learn all about this soon enough.
give me a break, Sticky said, ducking his head.
Ians mind finally made the exciting connection.
Youre here to give the boys a proper education.
I think so, she said, and whacked Artemis right
But it was they, not the Executives,who waited.
Sticky was the only one still wearing bandages.
Try to keep it down, Curtis, said Prue finally.
He knew the Whisperer wantedStickys given name.
I think I should bring you the disk, said Merv.
To strI've, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
Nearby, Nicks metallic quills began quI'vering.
She felt very young as he held her to his side.
In that case, Im to give you a message from Mr.
Sensitive and delicately balanced, said Sticky.
Shefrowned at the ceiling, then looked at Kate.
Its creepy, he said, eying the woods nervously.
He always looked forward to seeing the flowers.
Together they lifted the lid and looked inside.
Im just here for my brother, said Prue finally.
She looked like she didn know about them, even.
He finally snapped, rearing majestically on his
The girls quiz scores finally began to improve.
I see one possible weapon trained on the stage.
Everything I've read has beendull as doorknobs.
I think youve spent a bit too long under water.
five minutes, hesaid when the children came in.
Rasmussen looked pleased with himself until Ms.
Fancy place, this, commented the drI'ver wryly.
On the way home, Stink told Judy what happened.
Max looked at his roommate, who lay on the cot.
Well, I've had a few talks with her since then.
Enver cocked an eye sideways and looked at her.
The next few minutes were wretched ones indeed.
I've enlisted the aid of some personal friends.
He wasnt used to being interrupted in mid-rant.
Yes, he said, as long as I live, Ill come back.
Every head in the room swI'veled to see who had
Finally, a flutter of wings sounded from above.
Nothing, said Cormac finally, shaking his head.
It will be up to you to choose the safest time.
You've been an Executive for almost a year now.
I think thats really mean, Dad, Nicole scolded.
little, I used to stick you in an oatmeal bath.
I think we should get back to HQ, Grub offered.
After a time, they arrI'ved at an intersection.
The children were finally making some progress.
What Im wondering is what my dmon will be like.
They heard the first scream five minutes later.
I am, said Max, meeting the mans impassive gaze.
You have no idea how much I'vemissed all of you.
Of course I can take alternative forms, said Mr.
How fortunate that we can understand each other.
Oh, Iwould never have forgiven myself if he had!
How could a mouse out on a shelf not be nervous?
Who is the better Recon officer in your opinion?
But I believe we should all have a look at this.
Do you understand what I am saying to you, Runt?
Minutes later, Max waited by the roadside as Mr.
She looked around and said to the other ghosts: 
He had never used the priests given name before.
Sixty seconds later the boys were alone with Mr.
Anyway, theyve just installed a wall television.
So dont be scared, dontgive up, dont lag behind.
While you are alive, your business is with life.
It seemed to float,unmoored, on the rI'ver mist.
I will be theambassador and speak for the group.
He looked intently at Prue and said, Incredible.
Dame Mako glared at the Workshop representative.
He never could resist needling the smug centaur.
Thenext entry, he said, was dated a year later: 
Why do you want to work for these jerks, anyway?
Anyway, Trouble will probably have the situation
She had just arrI'ved at the door tothe kitchen.
David looked unsettled by the sudden prospect of
I think I can trace the sequence of events here.
Informed luck, I think, is a better description.
Just one hope, the only plan they couldthink of.
In and out, whip-whap, I've done it lots before.
I think we need to talk about your next project.
The Agent knelt down andlooked David in the eye.
That voice, delivering that judgment, shook Mrs.
Just as an atomic bomb needs a high explosive to
I think we all know what DArvit means, said No1.
Finally, he said, Time for Operation Guinea Pig!
I think we both know Piper would rather see you.
The crowd collectively heaved a worried grumble.
What happened next shut Mulch up all on its own.
Are you two talking about Jackson the Executive?
The man looked askance at Reynie, sizing him up.
Its true, our lives are short compared to yours.
So thats what I'vebeen doing the past few years.
no tighter around the middle than it used to be.
It took a few minutes, but finally Holly got it.
Ten minutes later there was a knock on the door.
I think youre being a little gentle on yourself.
Every time I see a pretty girl, I waste valuable
As for Iorek, he examined the knife obsessively.
Victory is never as sweet as I think it will be.
I've brought you some new tools, said Rasmussen.
I've got to gotheyre going to surrender David to
I've come to tell you, my Lord Regent, she said.
Please be kind to Lyra for as long as she lives.
I've never heard of any such thing, said Sticky.
This is the sorriestkaleidoscope I've ever seen.
He stopped and looked around, and she was right.
Let me explain what happened, said Opal sweetly.
Reynie looked to see if Jackson had noticed her.
Quiet, it was so quietthat she finally lay down.
Yes, I see your point, Foaly, said Sool silkily.
They dont seem to be angry anyway, or dangerous.
Totally hairless, actuallyalopecia unI'versalis.
And looking at the children he said, Forgive me.
Reynie and the others exchanged furtive glances.
McDaniels, rubbing his arms and giving a nervous
If you were more attentive, you would know that.
Reynie cast a nervous glance out beyond thecave.
You didnt bring your cutter, I seem to remember.
Thiswas not the Maggie V the public was used to.
Hello, said the badger when he arrI'ved at Prue.
Every tree will be toppled, every glade consumed.
Fredle didnt see anything that looked like a cat.
Benedict sent this to the captain to give to you.
Prue looked over at the other side of the ravine.
I think hes changed his SIM, so I cant track him.
How could he refuse to drink without discourtesy?
Iphigenia dismissively waved her hand in the air.
Prues father arrI'ved at the reunion sopping wet.
This is what the Extinctionists used to be about.
Finally, she said, I just want you to know that .
The clock at her bedside read three forty-five a.
Finally he couldnt stand the suspense any longer.
Assuming, you know, that we survI've long enough.
I never smelled those sneakers before in my life!
This prompted acollective moan of disappointment.
Anyway, you cant count Milligan out, Reynie said.
Imafraid I dont quite understand, he said to her.
The city was alive with not only light but music.
I think shes having trouble with her perspective.
Theyd still be on the perimeter, sniffing around!
I regret nothing, except that I never flew again.
Id only slip out from under the seat belt anyway.
Id be a lot more nervous not knowing wherehe was.
Finally Lyra had to plead with them to hold back.
Judy looked up to read the old-timey wooden sign.
But you havent given us your name, Kate insisted.
A moment later, Cooper set David down beside him.
Marshal was not used to back talk from an inmate.
If three of us are given up, then the restcan go.
And had he not lived a full and adventurous life?
Then I see something out of the corner of my eye.
Reynie rolled over and looked down from his bunk.
Curiously enough, these were the only ones given.
Then Jillson and the other Executive hurried out.
He knew he was showing off but he said it anyway.
Seor Lorca emerged a moment later holding a long-
It didnt fool me, and I think I lost my appetite.
Have you noticed how deceptive the distances are?
Rilf looked at Fredle and then at the Rowdy Boys.
Its my daughter who has to live, and its our task
Its not as if Missus doesnt give you enough food.
Anyway, I agreed assoon as I heard what she said.
The sweetest soul I've ever known, she whispered.
They might have been the only people in theworld.
I just dont understand why everyone is mad at me.
I certainly wouldnt give it to anyone else, ever.
I see you managedto cheat the mind wipe, Artemis.
Oh, I think someone needs to get hurt, said Opal.
from her crib when hed finally gotten her to bed.
I've been staring at it all day, Kate was saying.
There is one bear I've heard of whos trustworthy.
He took a ponderous drag and looked back at Prue.
I was getting out anyway; he just tipped me over.
Do you know what the word respect actually means?
After what seemed like an eternity, they arrI'ved
I think Ill go shout at the prisoner for a while.
If theres any more news, Ill be sure to tell you.
He never ordered me not to reenter the house, and
What do they want with the three who are given up?
But Opal Koboi never left herself without options.
Curtis looked at the ladder as he swung toward it.
The last broadcast finally relented just as Reynie
Later, she said, her voice muffled by the plastic.
I thought this was an exclusively military prison!
Youd finally have the chance to get your own back.
I cant hold a pen very well with these on, anyway.
Finally, a voice came frombeyond the hamper walls.
Well, I think theyre cute as a bugs ear, said Mom.
They will be waiting at the bridge at first light.
I think you proved a leopard can change its spots.
Three long quills were stuck shivering in his paw.
We got here, she thought, thats part of it anyway.
I think were getting to know one another too well.
give me one piece of your armor, any one you like.
Not one thatwouldnt make Trixle suspicious anyway.
The situation was finally growing clear to Reynie.
Is there no medicine you can give me to take back?
He couldnt outrun it and he couldntdrI've it away.
Apparently Id received a serious blow to the head.
Its not such a dumb idea, Sticky said defensively.
His expression darkened; his lip began to quI'ver.
Who are the only people for whom that is possible?
When shed finished, she looked at Will, exhausted.
And what were all these onions doing here, anyway?
Forgive me, I thought wed discussed this, said Mr.
And anyway, there are cameras all over this place.
Hey, my fidgeting isnt the only problem, you know!
Aisling looked back down at the sling in her hand.
Will finally recovered a little and looked around.
And, anyway, we had no desire to go back to Limbo.
that will break his spell, Ill be on my merry way.
He looked up into the air and then back at Fredle.
And you will never know the price of ourhappiness.
Anyway, how could they hope to succeed without me?
Holly stepped through what used to be the doorway.
I see, said Root, which was basically a lie again.
She is alive, said Basilides carefully, but also .
Finally, thought Artemis, a stroke or two of luck.
Once again Reynie and Sticky looked at each other.
First I want to hearyour version of what happened.
My beautiful old unI'versity is destroyedsomething
Finally, she shook her head, silver wig sparkling.
That sounds like two rules Ill learn, Reynie said.
The Whisperer was too perceptive for its own good!
The Archives wont open unless that door is locked.
The badger blinked and looked down at the manhole.
On Juliuss chest, right where the blur used to be.
Ill be all right, he gasped through gritted teeth.
Iorek looked at her steadily and then nodded once.
Moocho will be disappointed if you dont get it hot.
Curtain is every bit asreclusive as he is generous.
Her Pan, alone here: how could he live without her?
But after only a moment of outraged quI'vering, Mr.
But then most of what she writes is made up anyway.
Helooked at the others, feeling completely foolish.
Your crops, houses, and farms will be laid to ruin.
Oh, I think this game is over now, said Opal slyly.
Thengive me the flashlight and head for the stairs.
Kate turned, looked at the water ahead, and gasped.
I've got something better in mindsomethingharmless.
Butler rarely offered opinions on personal matters.
I never expected to see you, or anyone, ever again.
Trashmore used to be a huge garbage dump, said Mrs.
To be honest, I've been missing my bed, my friends.
They looked incredibly similar to the ones that the
And hows he know my dad calls her sweet pea anyway?
Cooper looked at his comrade with an expectant air.
You better get used to looking at me, my dear Opal.
Two other people died so I could live, he murmured.
Cooper emerged a moment later, dragging the bloated
He paused and looked out over the horizon of trees.
And if her laboratoryll still be hers whenshe does.
The instrument looked like a short length of pencil
Benedict is the only who can operate the Whisperer.
How do you know so much about smelly stuff, anyway?
How long could you be held for having novelty false
Forgiveme, he said, coming back and picking her up.
I think again about what Trixle said about Natalie.
I think Thatcher has an old coat thatmight fit you.
McDaniels looked past Augur at the assembled horde.
Where humans lived, therewould be mice living, too.
The command was delivered with calm, taut finality.
After all, he wouldnt give us an impossible riddle.
I wonder what she made of what happened last night.
Finally, her ladybug friend Polly paid her a visit.
Or unless you become Executives yourselves someday.
I've told you everything I know, Curtis, said Prue.
The Gallivespian was sitting cross-legged, entirely
I've tried, but my brain just goes round and round.
I dont blame you if you want to give yourselves up.
The band of escapees held their collective breaths.
Iphigenia lookedoff into the distance thoughtfully.
I've never seen so many upchucking kids in my life.
that David and I are supposed to go live with them.
Another five minutes, well be at the landing stage.
I think Fowl has somehow got hold of an LEP helmet.
I've often noticed that, but I cant understand why.
Im here to give you a tour of the farm, Bardo said.
David lookedterrified and tugged at Coopers sleeve.
Anyway, it was right prettycountry near Shropshire.
Seriously now, said the boy with a nervous chuckle.
I think we have some extenuating circumstances here.
I've had an appointment scheduled for weeks now, and
I never thought Id see the likes of you three again!
I think we may have a Bumper Sticker Bandit in Class
My left leg is broken, said the Gallivespian calmly.
I've got to takeyou straight to the Governor-Regent.
I've never met her; only heard some terrible things.
If you like, once my men are up we can drI've over  
It looks like they were done for anyway, Miss Koboi.
I mesmerized him, but still he refused to kill your 
I think hes looking for someplace cold, Lauren said.
I've heard the words, but I dont know what they are.
I've been thinking, Kate said as the boys recovered.
Kate looked for any sign of Milligan but found none.
It will be a long day, and youll need your strength.
Max sat up straight and turned toward their drI'ver.
Max peered through the double doors to the Archives.
Iwould like you to have it; I think Holly would too.
I've got an idea Id like to put to the good General.
Benedict with an assessing,contemplative expression.
To run away like that after theway I've treated you!
What do you know about your delivery to Delphi Keep?
What I mean is well finally be rid ofthat awful git!
They quI'vered like so many hungry, lapping tongues.
They all looked to Sticky, who shrugged regretfully.
Out of the corner of my eye I see Jimmy outside Mrs.
This is the way to the Archives, said Vilyak simply.
Number Two, drI've like a fiend and never look back!
His hand instinctively went to the saber at his hip.
And when she looked through, everything was changed.
With great effort, Reynie finally managed to sit up.
Anyway, I suppose to Martina you seem like a threat.
Hesitate five seconds and Ill drop itinto the water.
His expression was the only one that contained hope.
Seconds later, air rushed beneath the bombers wings.
He looked down from his perch, proud and disdainful.
Everyone but the Executives who disappeared with Mr.
He never gained a centimeterin fact, he lost ground.
He looked as though hed been trampled by a stampede.
She looked like she hadnt slept since Prue had left.
Ten seconds later, his face appeared in the opening.
Stink was the first one out of bed the next morning.
Theo, he said, I think SchoolmasterGoodwyn is right.
Their opinions make more difference to me thanyours.
Coopers dmon shivered and swooned againsthis breast.
Theres more about it in the next entry, Sticky said.
Dont worry, I wont give up my friends, Kate snapped.
The only thing to do is to coax them out by a trick.
The way I see it, you need a metal man and a monkey?
For the first time ever I felt I was doing something
After a brisk walk, they arrI'ved at the fire tower.
I dont think the deliverymen can find Rowan anymore.
I hate to say this, Holly, but I think were sinking.
Plausibility is the key to effective suggestion, Mr.
I've been wishing you luck from the moment I met you.
My mom says a school cant make Natalie normal anyway.
Hello, said Ian, nervous about meeting the strangers.
Dont be, love, said Bellagrog with a dismissive wave.
He turned his head away slowly, and then looked back.
It is a mission  one that may put your lives at risk.
it galled her to pay someone who used to be a friend.
needed to be certain of your help Please understand  
finally found it, he said as he held up a tweed coat.
I've traveled and seen more than I wanted to, Frigga.
It took him alittle while, but he finally spotted it.
Balthamos sat nearby, silent, and finally Will said: 
Or, at least, he used to win prizes for his cabbages.
Though despair must come first; and later, surprise, 
Her open, friendly, clever face looked back directly.
I've never met youbefore and I dont know who you are.
Tell me of the Outside; I've not heard in many years.
I think I can guess who your technical consultant is.
I think not, unless your tiny intruder has two heads.
Finally,every fairys worst nightmare was coming true.
A collective furor erupted from the gathered bandits.
Meanwhile, the first gyropters had arrI'ved above the
She looked around: gloom anddesolation on every side.
He looked as thoughhe would smell like a bar of soap.
From this moment on there will be no talking, period.
Finally Mulch arrived at a window that satisfied him.
I think this could be some sort of aftereffect of the
I feel as if I've got years and years of dirt on me .
Finally Iorek came to Will and said, This other edge.
The Executives knew what the girls were up to, and S.
That will come later, after you have proven yourself.
I think there should continue to be two ArtemisFowls.
A collective murmur arose from the surrounding cages.
How can I know that you wont hurt the childrenanyway?
It will be two days flying time, if I navigate truly.
Yes, but I never believed the stories, said the earl.
Winds changing, and goblin sniffers would give me own
His nest will be tended and kept till he is returned.
Ill be twelve in November, said Curtis between bites.
Ill be sure to hug him before I tease him, Kate said.
Atlantean food mostly, so get used to fish and squid.
I can give you the medicine, not tell you the secret.
Ill be here until the witches throw me in a sack and 
Id rather keep you close as long as possible, anyway.
Anyway, continued the doctor, how did he get in here?
had ever been in all their thirty-five years of life.
Finally, Madam Dimbleby said, Its a perfect name, Ian.
Your father is the most resilient man I've ever known.
Number Two looked at Milligan, who looked back at her.
Save your anger, said Astaroth with a dismissive wave.
I think youre being a little gentle on yourself, for a
Finally, he said, She can tell usnothing more, Dieter.
In rare cases, with exceptionally sensitive minds, Mr.
He swI'veled his eyes toward the otherchildren and Mr.
Reynie and the others looked anxiously at one another.
Anyway, if she shows up, we can deal with it, cant we?
He massaged his carrotlike fingers together nervously.
Rasmussen, motioning for his drI'ver to open the door.
Enver whistled dispiritedly and looked out the window.
Everything looked exactly the same in every direction.
He snorted derisively and looked out the window again.
Dont worry, I figured I could never publish it anyway.
When he was finished, he looked up at Prue and gawked.
And how long will it take to crack this Eternity Code?
Ill be totally honest with you: I was skipping school.
I think its one of the old wide-bore Softnose cannons.
I think its because you havent reached your limit yet.
Shefelt like the worlds most effective bad luck charm.
Shutting it down meant that he was finally letting go.
The way I see it, you never get something for nothing.
I think hes been one step ahead of us all the way, and
As an answer the witch took an arrow from her quI'ver.
But I thought we were going to the Archives, said Max.
The Executives had a sheet of paper with them now that
Finally, when the boat wasnt rocking anymore, he stood
And therefore worth an absolute fortune, agreed Foaly.
Moments later they saw Kate step boldly into Room 7-B.
For a moment, the Agent looked utterly bewildered; his
You cant wake up something that isnt alive and asleep.
Thank you anyway, he said, tossing the pillowcaseback.
No reason, said Max, putting up his hands defensively.
I've gone on far too long about your poor old captain.
They had plenty of other things to talk about, anyway.
Buttons finally stood and slowly approached the fence.
I promised to return it before the next stop, he said.
give me a minute, said Kate, reaching into her bucket.
These imps act like they never heardthis story before.
Hearingit, they looked at each other and gave a laugh.
They felt another one during lunch the next day it was
But moving quickly was the only defense Balthamos had.
After a night with too few sessions, hed finally got a
All the Executives have reported how well youre doing.
I've just dealt a terrible blow to the best part of S.
This was followed by a crazed string of negatives: No!
Why mention olive trees nearby and no cork or pine for
Anyway, I didnt have time to pickand choose, you know.
Raising himself to his highest, he said, I understand.
A moment later there was another pop and the mouse was
Their victory had been decisive, their losses minimal.
Curtis looked up to see the bandits snap to attention.
Then they looked at one another and shook their heads.
The police at the hotel will be vigilant, I assure you.
Sweat ran in little rI'vers down Scott McDanielss face.
In time every animal will be talking about our actions.
Well, were not coming to Lord Asriel anyway, said Will.
They think theyve got the only sharp teeth on the farm.
finally worked up the courage to feel the moon madness.
You are making a mistake, though you give us no choice.
And the next moment they all heard what she had sensed.
I was to take you to the island and give you a message!
Guys, called Max, I've got to go somewhere with Cooper.
But once I've started something, you see, I like to f  
Ill bet thoseExecutives are always patroling the place.
The knife tip leapt on the rock under the massive blow.
We can talk later, but right now we haveforaging to do.
angle, were about the only ones who could see him down.
After a moment, shecautiously looked over her shoulder.
As I've told you repeatedly, you are never to touch it.
anyway, the local seas are thronged with fishing boats.
Lyra looked up and held out her hand for the dragonfly.
Max glanced at his watchhed been asleep for five hours.
The controls were a bit heavier than Mulch was used to.
It worries me that this may give them even more reason.
I've come all this way; youre the only hope left to me.
Therefore, said Riley, using a big word to sound super-
And anyway, all that cheese wasmaking the ground soggy.
The idea of eating withthem made him even more nervous.
A loud,authoritative voice was coming down the hallway.
A wonderful woman in my opinion, but with absolutely no
and the same latex used to glue the mike to his throat.
The gathered bandits looked to her and back at Brendan.
Its as if Im doing somethingright every time I see him.
Then theyll go on along the rI'ver and leave you alone.
And therefore worth a fortune, concluded the commander.
The Receiver would be considered insufficient evidence.
Chicken delivery, Kate said with a nod of satisfaction.
Finally, the smoke began to clear and Curtis could make
They heard about what happened to my friend and came to
Finally, his fingers closed round No1s silver bracelet.
Amma and Pati will be along as soon as the carsrunning.
They can drI've ya batty, family can, but bloods blood.
A moment later, the four ofthem were laughing together.
Two years and eleven months, the girl said defensively.
I dont trust the force as much as I used to, Commander.
I see, said Thatcher, and his worried look intensified.
None of it was enough to give me any clues, but I could
I just dont want to speak for you, said Kate evasively.
Prue asked the next question: Whats the Ancients Grove?
I have heard that the dogs can chase them off, but I've
Of course you could always give up and go back to them.
He pulled the cloak around himself and looked up again.
I hope Newton does not get cold feet out on the rI'ver.
Mom used to try to make me take a nap in the afternoon.
I hate to waste time getting from one placeto the next.
Mother went as a star-ship trooper, I seem to remember.
Reynie looked at the paper, but it was too dark to read.
I see your Gnommish has come back to you, sniffed Holly.
Do you know what you have to do to begin breathing fire?
Youd be crossing the rI'ver before you ever even saw me.
You never know when a rodents perspective will beneeded.
Mac was rI'veted, a broad smile splayed across his face.
I wish I had never given up the battlefield for themill.
It looked ugly now; it looked like what it was, wounded.
And his first campaign will be to destroy yourRepublic .
You must have got that number from one of my Executives.
Makes me nervous, he said, finding the cloth on his desk
Finally the celebration began and the doors were opened.
The children looked at one another, not daring to speak.
May God forgive me as I barter lives thatare not my own!
Seattle Times The narrative is fun and laced with puns .
It might still like being alive, in spite of everything.
disappeared some time ago and was finally declared dead.
He looked up, surprised, his eyes tired and glazed over.
The drI'ver rapped a stick impatiently against the cart.
I dont understand the question, said Artemis truthfully.
Risker looked around at the children, his chest heaving.
Zero zero six five nine, blurted out the hysterical man.
When we leave the world of the dead, will we live again?
We are used to running in and out of each others houses.
Artemis paused to give him the full effect of his words.
But Im not sure because I think you broke my funny bone.
Her decisiveness seemed to drI've the othersinto action.
Those are the only three words that keep being repeated.
Otherwise my Executives would be unable to operate them.
Oh, weve finally decided to earn our retainers, have we?
Well, little one, I see you have met our stripednosegay.
Well, Im sorry, said Will, but that sounds feeble to me.
It looked so odd thatthey didnt know what to make of it.
Once hed slaked the thirst, he sat up and looked around.
Artemis, I think I mentioned that its a stealth shuttle.
Both ofthem looked strong, capable, ruthless, and proud.
When she finally wakes up, the last week will be a blur.
Well be alive again in a thousand blades of grass, and a
Creeping to the hills summit, the boys looked out upon a
Then we know how long shes been in the area, said Perry.
Yes, I knowI've learned a thing or two as well, my dear.
Theres nothing dirty about them, said David defensively.
Then Baruch would be proud of you, said Will, shivering.
And no one looked askance at him as he crossedthe plaza.
Then we go straight to plan B, and you get wiped anyway.
You forget I've collected a few of these, said Milligan.
Come to think of it, most of my relatives would fit that
They looked around for a piece of paper inside the cage,
But there will still be two of us left to deal with you,
This is it, he said conclusively, glancing at his watch.
Constance, though, looked not just annoyed but perplexed
And tomorrow they all would drI've to Stonetown to see .
With luck Ill be backbefore youre even finished digging.
used to sticking her fingers into other peoples insides.
I think I preferred him when he spoke like an old movie.
He looked around: there was nothing else he could carry.
In his dark suit he looked unnervingly like a giant bat.
I happento know that that womans army is pretty massive.
Something caught his eye, howe'ver, and helooked upward.
He arrI'ved and addressed the people in the Plaza Mayor.
Sit tight, everyone, and Ill be back soon with our ride.
Four points already and I think theres a fifthcoming up.
A few minutes later a light began flashing in the woods.
Has the blackberry wine given you delusions of grandeur?
Spiders made Reynie nervous, but he wasnt afraid ofthem.
In the next moment, the drapeweed seemed to swallow him.
In front of him, in the only chair, sat Father MacPhail.
Ian asked, suddenly much more nervous than he wasbefore.
Nice to finally meet you face-to-face, if not eye-to-eye.
You know I never usually wear jewelry, but there is this.
It aint so badive had worse in the mess hall, believe me!
The world we lived in was a vale of corruption and tears.
The drI'ver was in despair, but he did the best he could.
Youre the last Executive promoted before the Improvement.
You always wanted to see the Archives, said David softly.
I cant hear a word when youre all whispering, anyway, and
Lyra looked into Wills brilliant, strong eyes and smiled.
And I've heard it saidbut everybody says its one of those
Ill go in first, said Kate, despite feeling very nervous.
Reynie woke before dawn, shivering and drenched in sweat.
The hawks and hummingbirds all exchanged nervous glances.
The house was quiet, but they werent the only ones awake.
And I admit Im only joking when I sayI've befriended her.
Ill be sure to have some refreshments sent to your rooms.
Given the situations sensitivity, its out of thequestion.
the doorway and looked upon Bryn McDaniels one last time.
Do you know how long it would take to build a wall out of
Or at least they used to be before I threw in with Holly.
Kate shrugged dismissively, but secretly she was pleased.
Best hurry or she will be lost, entombed within the Sidh.
Brendan looked away, over at the milling band of bandits.
I've never quite understood why you people favor them so.
Where you perceive a threat, we recognize an opportunity.
Are you going to live with Tarnu and Ellnu in their nest?
What makes you think you know so much about girls anyway?
I've told her that, lots of times, but she doesnt listen.
and shrI'veled, peering at him from beneath a brown hood.
I never leave home without being fully prepared, he said.
Id give anything to ride on a pirate ship, said Tall Boy.
you pay for being an Executive, doing the important work.
Here the officer looked around the room conspiratorially.
I meant to get your attention earlier, but youlooked so .
I mean, I really found someplace where I felt I belonged.
I've got it, muttered Cooper, taking ahold of Maxs wrist.
Probablywhat happened out on the lawn today, he grumbled.
If youre ready, Ill give you a brieftour of the Workshop.
He was well aware of Number Twos fearsome protectiveness.
He went up close to the field mouse to ask, In what ways?
To which he, pointing to the horse, replied, I've noidea.
Why is it people always ask me to do these things anyway?
If South Wood refuses to do so, howe'ver, it will be war.
If anyone was sensitive to Constances volatile moods, Mr.
This bridge,she thought, will be gone when the ivy comes.
Theyll probably hang youanyway, as a party to our escape.
This meant that it could be focused to a certaindiameter.
but she is unable to guess what surprise he has in store.
It reminded him of the day she had driven him to take Mr.
He looked back at the far side of the gully and squinted.
give me a pen and paper, said Reynie, making up his mind.
Fox,she said, finally, I am a woman of infinite patience.
I dont think you understand, young man, said Doctor Lane.
Seor Lorca looked at Miss Boon with an amused expression.
Curtis looked back and forth between Prue and the Mystic.
The children took their seats and looked about the study.
I think thatmaybe youre the useless one in this equation.
The car had returned and was waiting on the weedy drI've.
It stopped abruptly and swI'veled its head to gazeat Max.
The bandit, now enlivened, began chanting, Free Wildwood!
Most likely a tunnel, given its placement, said Milligan.
If theres any trouble, Ill head you off before youarrI've.
Lyra went and looked, and came back at once, looking pale.
Our telescopes will be hidden there inthe brush, she said.
He shook his head and lookedover his pipe at the children.
finally broke the spell and urged him to bolt to his feet.
This explains why we must be very careful when we arrI've.
Curtis could see a deep sinew inhis neck tense and shiver.
And can you guess what youll find when you do cut through?
And anyway, its a pittance compared to what this deal will
If the Executives spotted them, she was sure to be caught.
I buried them in the field where you will never find them.
He says this louder now, like Im too stupid to understand.
Three times now I've stepped in to pluck her out ofdanger.
You put the letter and talisman in the Archives, said Max.
I see a little boy wearing a cowboy hat driving a toy car.
Rasmussen slipped inside, and the drI'ver closed the door.
He turned it to the tall side and looked athis reflection.
Seconds later, there wasthe slow measure of clanking iron.
She held up the handcuff key that McCracken had given her.
Now, I've told you my story, so you have to tell me yours.
Finally, setting down his mug of wine, he found his voice.
Im surprised nobody has ever given you a suitable present.
Will thought she looked as if she remembered it very well.
Pretty crazy, he said, finally, gesturing toward the camp.
five days ago, I saw my brother taken by a flock of crows.
Given the likelihood of disloyalty among your ranks, I can
I realize now, finally, that I must be the one to save it.
Shielding isnt as foolproof as it used to be, noted Foaly.
Mary felt as if the ground had given way beneath her mind.
Since then I've just been sitting around in an empty room.
Finally they came up to a low rise at the rear of the gym.
Root knew he was being goaded, but he blew his top anyway.
Her heart surged with protectiveness for her baby brother.
He opened the drI'vers-side door and climbed into his car.
For the second time in his life, Max looked upon Astaroth.
What makes you thinktheres anything on it in the Archives?
But Jaaved didnt understand and he cocked his head at Ian.
Finally he said, Foaly, there must have been a second orb.
Max swI'veled to look as the man leaned out over the rail.
Id alwaysfound a way out of it, but finally they insisted.
He looked down at Missus from above, and she didnt look so
If it all depends on her, couldthey risk letting her live?
I think shes alive because her apple hasnt turned to gold.
I think it might be a good idea to do the smelliest first.
McDaniels looked gravely at the black shape but nodded his
Im embarrassed by this, children, and askyour forgiveness.
For a moment Opalcould not understand what she was seeing.
Nobodys going off alone to live with any witches, said Mr.
Very well, I am on a southerly heading anyway, so why not 
I heard his call and flew to him, but I arrI'ved too late.
Mums eyes widened in shock; her lower lip began to quI'ver.
She looked as cranky and unhappy as they had ever seen her.
It would still be day, out there in thekitchen, he thought.
YaYa crossed the rI'ver and clambered up its shallow banks.
You could tell because I used her name when I spoke to her.
Sir, may I please be excused totake Theo to Madam Dimbleby?
You boys will like the Workshop, said the drI'ver, smiling.
Theother children looked at one another in despair, and Mr.
Then he looked back at Prue and said, Okay, get in the van.
Curtains saying that the Whisperer could perceive thoughts.
Ill be fine, Mum, said Miss Boon, kissing the hags topknot.
When Im grown up Ill be able to look after her properly, in
nanosecond as Cruik finally ran out of nether-tunnel steam.
I think I split a gut getting rid of that wind, said Mulch.
At any rate its the only goodplace to bring the plane down.
Once more Mercury dived into the rI'ver, and brought up the
For all we know the next clue may be hidden on the ship, or
I think someone has reprogrammed your amorphobots, centaur.
Self-sufficiency is our driving creed, replied the drI'ver.
Is Lord Asriel actively searching for the girl and the boy?
That was the first living thing I've seen today, Will said.
Things were getting a little too serious around hereanyway.

Anyway, Ive seen enough snowto last me the rest of my life.
Anyway the Safetynet has a self-destruct, like everything I
I never even smelled fresh air till I cast my lot with you.
She really had no choice, and finally went along with them.
Anyway, you want her, she went south, toward the mountains.
Typical of humans, they neverexpected an attack from below.
Connor looked in disbelief at David and gave a short laugh.
He could investigate later, if there were a later for them.
Shes lying, he said to Iorek Byrnison thirty minutes later.
My thoughts exactly when I first arrI'ved here in Wildwood.
Finally, she swept it out the door and Stink scooped it up.
We shall help you, because thats the task we've been given.
But why dont you explain it to her and give her the choice?
Its too far for a mouse to go on his own, through the wild.
In fact she was about todeliver an insulting rhyme when Mr.
Arthur said, I think you mean Are these all there are, Dad.
Hed ask if any othermice lived nearby, and where they were.
Kate looked up and saw the boys staring at her wonderingly.
Finally, from amidst the battle, a horn sounded once again.
The only way fears truly disappear is if you confront them.
I was nervous to have you in my cabin, Captain Noland said.
Ill bet most of the Executives used to be special recruits.
The next question read: Do you like to listen to the radio?
Guten Tag, Herren, said the drI'ver, holding open the door.
The bridge promptly bucked and flailed as if it were alive.
You know I never usually wear jewellery, but there is this.
The rickshaw drI'ver paused for a moment before responding.
He wants to give the children a head start, said McCracken.
I think we shouldnt translate the new scroll, he announced.
It was also a good excuse to flee the whimpering and moans.
I did switch them, but it was long before you arrI'ved, Mr.
The Mystic frowned and looked at the ground as they walked.
The drI'ver cautiously lowered the rifle and gaped at Prue.
The ghost children looked up with a passionate longing, and
An hourlater, Max was sitting by the fire, listening to Mr.
It told her: Do not try, because your lives depend on them.
Max shivered and rubbed his arms whileCooper rang the bell.
It was hydrogel, used to safely transport injured sea life.
I've already made the arrangements, said Cannonball kindly.
Had to give them consolation doughnuts and hugs andwhatnot.
I've always thought that was a funny expression, Kate said.
Until at last the moon said, All right, I give up, Ill stop.
his mind raced to understand what the couple was getting at.
He finally went into the water, and I slipped as I followed.
Root paused to make certain his wishes were being respected.
Ill be backkeep going, replied Max, springing up the stairs.
Your family lives near a snake, they live nearrats and cats.
I havent come here to parley with a scrivener, she told him.
I think we have our distraction Moocho Brazos just arrI'ved.
Youll just fall asleep, anyway, fall off and hurt your head.
He put the glasses back on and blinked his big,nervous eyes.
She took a few tentative sips, and her voicebecame stronger.
Her dragonfly, wings quI'vering, was being held by Tialys on
I know, for instance, how the messages are being delivered  
Curtain had at last settled into some real, productive work.
I see youve made theacquaintance of two of my pets, he said.
If the Governess were alive, wed have heard long before now.
It takesabout thirty-five seconds to set properly, she said.
If the Oracle said dead, he meant to produce the bird alive.
I think it would be a bad idea to cut backour guard forces .
As if on cue, Captain Noland yawned and looked at his watch.
Then that join was made, and Iorek turned to the next piece.
He was not the only one at the table with troubled thoughts.
Icant remember; I think one is more invasive than the other 
I've asked the people in South Wood forhelpthey did nothing.
Finally managing to stand, he looked at where hed just been.
Fredle looked through the window but could see onlydarkness.
I've been lookingforward to this ever since my last session.
Opal Koboi is loose, and I think shes behind the Zito probe.
anyway, now Doodah would have a chance to make it up to her.
Im afraid, howe'ver, that Im not much given to hope anymore.
coating of wet earth, and his beard hair bristled nervously.
Brendan looked on into space, his face betraying no emotion.
He looked each of the captains in the eye before continuing.
Finally they asked if she had any more ideas, and she said: 
You dont understand how much this means to me, she whispers.
I think you might need a warrant to take one more step, cop.
Nigel blinked and looked up gratefully from the photo album.
Father Gomez said, And do you remember what she looked like?
No, I dont think you understand just how stupid goblins are.
Heaving a deepsigh, he looked back up at Prue and continued.
Not long, then, Rec observed, and he, too, looked at Fredle.
Still, Reynie stared nervously at the dark hole in the rock.
They flowed steadily down the tunnel like a rI'ver of light.
And why did hego off by himself to make those calls, anyway?
I've got lots of people to talk to, snapped Max defensively.
David ignored Connor and looked skeptically at the creature.
Neither has wholly forgiven us for choosing the middle road.
Now Stink looked skinny as a pencil and tall as Abe Lincoln.
He never turned down the opportunity to earn a little money.
The gyptians arrI'ved on the afternoon of the following day.
Coulter has arrI'ved and that she wishes to see him at once.
I've developed a bit of a bad reputation in certain circles.
The victor will be clear; the forest will inform me of this.
And it was thoughts of her mother that finally calmed Holly.
Prue lifted her head from the bed and lookedaround her room.
Finally, even the otters were exhausted from all of the fun.
They wished her luck, and moments later the girls were gone.
I can finallyoffer some answers to your questions, howe'ver.
Thats the most god-awful thing I've ever seen, sputtered Mr.
She looked at him coolly, aware of the ferocity of his pride.
Im glad we finally get to meet, Buddy Boy says in a low tone.
Hed been terrified himself and didnt want to be the only one.
I doubt he lived, but if he did, hes surely wishing he hadnt.
All the reasons why no one lives up in those parts of Russia.
Also, it was nice not to be the only one afraid ofKates bird.
Madame Oxentiel had been the Gallivespians second-in-command.
Do you by any chance know what happened to the ladys husband?
For a moment  a fleeting moment  Kate looked desperately sad.
Brendan finally pulled away, returning to the grove of trees.
while they think I can still use it, I've got the upper hand.
Maybe half a minute later, he heard Opals voice from outside.
From the next room, he heard the sounds of music and singing.
Stanley and Arthur had both wanted to paddle, and finally Mr.
Because of that phrase we heard on the Receiver, said Reynie.
Yes, madam, said the drI'ver, looking back at her gratefully.
I never knew pajamas could get a person into so much trouble!
The dog shrugged his shoulders and looked away down the hall.
Finally, the professor and the Moroccan reached an agreement.
Surely you would not do that,she whispered into the receiver.
Brendan, explained Curtis defensively, Brendan gave em to me.
IF YOU ARE CAUGHTTALKING IT WILL BE ASSUMED YOU ARE CHEATING.
The dog, apparently surprised to be spoken to, looked around.
She left the clothes on the bank and slipped into the rI'ver.
I think I was at the nurses office getting myhearing checked.
Well, hardy har har, thats the funniestthing I've ever heard.
I never joke, said Root, and he said it with a straight face.
I've told you a dozen times, said Max, I dont want to use Mr.
When he did finally acquiesce and open his eyes, he screamed.
These were individuals, lively with intelligence and purpose.
Prue stopped briefly and looked from one parent to the other.
Whisperer is a sensitive  how did he say it, exactly, Sticky?
But likewise are we the children of an indifferent unI'verse.
You would just arrI've later and later wasnt such a big deal,
I just dont understand how it could be in two places at once.
The shelter was suffused with the smell of expensive cologne.
I've never met a grown-up who believed me capable of thought.
You remember what happened on our family holiday to Brighton?
Might be a promotion in it for meIll be a decorated war hero.
Who knows what lives down here, responded one of the coyotes.
A few minutes later a reply flashed from the mainland trees: 
Prue was shocked to see that it was being driven by a coyote.
Used to profess her undying love for Professor Rupert Smythe.
Max looked up; it was the samewoman and child from the ledge.
The present-time Abbot had barely time to say, What happened?
The attendees leaned forward to glimpse whoever had arrI'ved.
I like how you kids stuck it out and didnt give up, said Dad.
She lifted the King up by theshoulder and looked at his back.
Memories, opinions and secrets were laid bare for all to see.
The Workshop is neutral in the affair, he replied decisively.
You must tell them true stories, and everything will be well.
The first thing he did was to look for the Gallivespians, who
Oh, I felt such a love,such a tenderness, such a deep, deep .
The heads eyes suddenly blinked and swI'veled to look at her.
The next entry explains why the special recruits arent sosad.
Dazed by the insistence of the owls question, Prue looked on.
This was understandable, she thought, given theirpredicament.
A collective murmur of fear erupted from the gathered bandits.
At once the cold struck into hisbones, and he began to shiver.
You know, if she doesnt survI've this, the question of whether
Anyway, Dad had just returned from a trip to the Grand Tetons.
Here, give them more hay, and put plenty of litter under them.
Will looked to his left, where the voice was, but saw nothing.
It is beautiful that you saw her again, said Lucia decisively.
When they finally got unstuck, Stink looked at the Great Wall.
Now that you have your stupid plant, were not much use to you.
I can levitate her, offered Miss Boon, swI'veling in her seat.
And from now on I want to know whats going on, you understand?
Artemis couldnt ask, but his bodyguard knew the answer anyway.
A few minutes later, he receiveda response from the mainland: 
I doubt she survI'ved all that, said Cooper, shaking his head.
When she finally came out, her smile hadnt faded in the least.
Finally, he moved Theo to one of the couches and sat her down.
I think we must call upon one of your sisters, said the voice.
I think theyd be happy to know they gave you a chance to live.
I think your mothers lastthought must have been one of relief.
They were the only two humanbeings in that vast gulf of death.
Thosewho surrender will be treated with fairness and leniency.
Both had their heads in their hands and looked ready toscream.
Both here, both alive, said the Chevaliers voice near his ear.
For those viewers just joining us, five world leaders are dead
Kate swI'veled her own eyes to see what Sticky was looking at.
We know you can understand us, Jaaved, Theo said, more gently.
There are olive trees nearby the whole wall, and hardly a pine
I see it, he shouted to Qwan, who was on his knees beside him.
I've been so busy that everything inbetween seems like a blur.
The wolf only looked up and said, I hear you, my young friend.
The slap of the rope on the flagpole above was the only sound.
Exactly, said Opal, gratified that someone finally understood.
Max looked back at the cowardly vyes slinking among the trees.
Most likely it will be after dark, when the others are asleep.
Rhonda will have given you a few details concerning your trip.
Prue looked at the King imploringly and said, Can you help me?
Sticky looked nervously at Reynie, who said, What do you mean?
He growled low in his throat and the beastseyed him nervously.
He doesnt know where I've gone, and I must go back to himsoon.
I think Ill go out to the darkroom and develop that film right
Well, suddenly finding I've got a whole life to live, but no .
She looked at Will, and saw his puzzlement asclear as her own.
Our defensive cordons have been disabled, Rasmussen whispered.
How do you know the goblins arent just ripping off wholesalers?
The drI'ver did his best to appear calm, but Max saw tiny beads
I know, I've neglected it shamefully, I've hardly had a moment.
this side of the pond or Id have looked her up a long time ago!
In the next moment, she saw that the shark fin was only a rock.
Too bad we cant actually give them belly aches, said Constance.
As you see, I've designed an excellent remote control, said Mr.
Even though Im not used to explaining myself to the hired help.
Anyway, I cant open the camper, I appear to have lost the chip.
And finally  unable to help themselves  they burst outlaughing.
Theres a snakeSnakes live on mice, look out for snakes, Fredle.
And while we cannot see a way tosurvI've, we hope that you may.
She looked helplessly at Reynie,unable to think of what to say.
Shifting his weight, Max dug a massive paw into the soft earth.
They swI'veled their eyes toward one another, hearts hammering.
Constance, why on earth didyou decide to go down there, anyway?
Prue instinctively reached up and put her hand around the cord.
Thewitches will be back in a few weeks, and I want to be ready.
Now theres an order I never thought Id hear from you, she said.
This is too creepy, Sticky said, glancing nervously behind him.
Angeline cleared her throata little nervously, Artemis thought.
My mom doesnt answer, but I think she knows shes lost this one.
And to his immense relief, Madam Dimbleby seemed to understand.
And you and I could live here forever and just love each other.
Sometimes, when you cant, you have to anyway, Axle advised him.
Foaly was so amazed, he couldnt even formulate a smart comment.
He was nervous aboutthe spyglass and had wanted to seem casual.
No, the next thing I remember I was in an orphanage, said Kate.
That was the nicest letter I've ever received, the girl sighed.
He memorizes and understands Shakespeare after asingle reading.
Minutes later, Max understood why Miss Boon had looked so glum.
Kate had told herself she could handle the Executives, but shed
I see that all Oracles have a bit of wisdom beyond their years.
Anyway, death is no big deal, not compared to what comes after.
Sure enough, the only words that appeared in the bottom corners
Several moments later, he tossed the headphones on the console.
Several seconds later, he was blushing and his ears burned hot.
The camera finally creaked to a halt after a dozen revolutions.
Anyway, the classes are obviously linked to the hiddenmessages.
Before too long, she arrI'ved at the ladder Penny haddescribed.
And so Sticky only nodded and gave the next entry in anutshell.
After a moment, he cracked an eyelid and looked over at Curtis.
The children flinched and looked up to see him glaring at them.
Based on three conscious beingsnervous conscious beings I might
Vilyak asked as the moment arrI'ved when the screen went white.
I can only definitively say that Scott McDaniels is in this car.
Dad, said Max, shaking his head at his obsessively loyal father.
I think Ill just concentrate on finding my own time, he thought.
Ill be looking for you, Will, every moment, every single moment.
The only color was the occasional silver glint of rain, falling.
I turneda wooden skewer to stone, at least I think it was stone.
The metal clicking, I see now, is herring as it hits the ground.
I think we can be pretty sure that your probe has been hijacked.
The chutes made her nervous enough without riding in an antique.
Finally, near midnight, and just as Ian was sure he would not be
A good plan, said Cooper, closing his eyes with meditative calm.
Im sorry, sir, Ian said slowly, but Im afraid I dont understand.
that the engineers used to hand-crank themselves between pylons.
The commander did not understand any of this, nor did he wantto.
Stink looked at himself in the James Madison side of the mirror.
He looked as though he had endured a night of bad dreamshimself.
No enemies will be able to find us nowbymap, by road, or by sea.
McCracken looked at Constance as if he were disappointed in her.
Septimus looked over at the rope, as if unaware of the activity.
I think theres a giant nose here somewhere, he told his friends.
Miss Boon glanced at Jason Barrett, who blushed and looked away.
I think blame lies solely with the woman who wasjust at my door.
Im actually not supposed to know about them, she said nervously.
Finally a blond man with prominent cheekbones stepped forward to
Excuse me, officer, but I seem to have misplaced myjar of warts.
The goblin had paused to grab a set of wingsfrom the cargo hold.
Ill go lay these clothes on myradiator and try to sleep, anyway.
The girls,following Reynies lead, assumed attentive expressions.
All children get nervous on their first day at a new school, and
Finally it was the night before the morning of the big surprise.
beginning some of the male officers used to give me a hard time.
Not exactly the way he used to be, but closer tothat individual.
Finally he gave up trying to decide and simply wrote, I hope so.
I did not care to give you information you might use against me.
Her father looked at her with a humorous expression on his face.
I've told them again and again that I can handle it, saidSticky.
Theres no reason for her to be mad about it anyways, I tell her.
Benedict do, offer to pay you more money once we arrI'vedsafely?
And youre telling me all this because I wont remember it anyway.
Mulch was understandably curious, and not a little apprehensive.
He just wants to survI've out here until he can get back inside.
Oh, said Ian, finally understanding what Alfred was alluding to.
Two minutes later Reynie was alone on the plaza, breathing hard.
Its my job to show you how to survI've outside, althoughfrankly?
Well, I was starting tothink I was the only one, you know, who .
Constance looked at him and whispered, But how are we going to .
On the way, I see Jimmy down at the dock, tracking our progress.
When he saw it happen, the man looked at his own hand, appalled.
As they walked along the rI'vers edge, Max felt utterly exposed.
Do this right and you will never have to worry about moneyagain.
When he had gone, Penny looked at Prue, her eyes again wide with
When they had arrI'ved at the top of the wall, they discovered a
Jillson the Executive entered with a plastic jug and paper cups.
Ian looked down at his hands, nervously picking at his trousers.
To Max, the opening looked nakedstripped of its majesty now that
Just a bit cool todayand perhaps Im not used to the weather yet.
And on Lyras shoulder, and on Wills, rode the two Gallivespians.
Finally Sticky decided to make a point by pretending to run away.
It was awhile before she arrI'ved at the front door of her house.
Finally the editor burst out laughing and told him it was a joke.
I never thought I would say this, but I kinda like the new model.
Though Ill be sorry to leave this one; I've been very happy here.
I've not seen a more putrid, fetid stink of mange in all my days.
his expression alternating between anger and shivering curiosity.
Finally, when I can stand it no longer, my father agrees to talk.
But I've been putoff my schedule and am raging against the delay.
get a connection just like that, but thats exactly what happened.
He looked down at Fredle, crouching uneasily near his front paws.
Finally Pantalaimons wild screaming died away, and Kirjava said: 
I intend to return for him the moment I've ferried you to safety.
But I think you grew to love me for my charm and noble character.
Well have to look for her latersomething probably happened at the
Anyway, the man you want is in the little cottage with the window
If any child iscaught cheating, then he or she will be executed  
The date of this next entry is the day we arrI'ved on the island.
Two large men in black and a smaller, nervous-looking individual.
When you looked up at me just now, I saw a question in your eyes.
I think I had better get home as quickly as possible, thought Mr.
I've seen her birth certificate and yearbooks, forcryin out loud!
But as I understand it, this house has been empty for many years.
There was once a charcoal burner who lived and worked by himself.
Richter looked at the dark-haired boy as she stopped at the door.
There was a lively wind, and the great landscape was mottled with
Even with precautions,your situation will be extremely dangerous.
And Kate got nervous only when most childrenwould feel terrified.
Max looked down at the grass and felt the cool air wash over him.
So I thought Id give you a name, like King Iorek Byrnison gave me
Neldo, he reminded her, you live in the same woodshed as a snake.
Lyra will be safe, and the Kingdom will be powerless against her.
The thing you have to understand, Fowl, is that goblins are dumb.
A villain may disguise himself, but he will not deceive the wise.
Here a few seconds is how long it will takeyou to open your hand.
Next she looked from one door to the other, gauging the distance.
He was the best kind oflieutenant, as he never questioned orders.
A boy sat upon the drI'vers seat and offered a smile in greeting.
Her sobs racked her body and made it difficult to understand her.
Oh sure, I've had a bad scrape or two, but Im cautious,McCracken.
The girls will be wanting to see us, and show off their coonlets.
takes one look at Natalie and understands exactly whats going on.
Im careful, David said defensively, still examining the talisman.
He looked across at Tarnu and Ellnu, who were sleepingpeacefully.
A man and a satyr became friends and determined to live together.
I think you have pulled the wool over everyones eyes long enough.
Ian saw Madam Scargill pull nervously at the collar of her dress.
As of this moment, I am assigning you a most important objective.
a headache, and in my opinion, not one of them is worth adopting.
She had looked directly into the Ten Mans eyes, and what shed seen
Benedict tended to use humor to defuse Constances explosive moods.
What happened to Adrastus after the Carthaginians conquered Lixus?
A moment later, Max found himself blinking at an elfin creature no
Just out of interest, Julius, why have you travelled all this way?
In case any of the details are important, Ill give you all I have.
Before now, you see, hed had only a glimpse into hisparents lives.
Ian regarded her nervously, feeling embarrassed to be singled out.
She looked out at the vista beyond the window; the birds weregone.
Shed been afraid to disappoint him but terrified to give him more.
In the distance, dozens of small figures fidgeted nervously in the
Lets go down to the barn and give our ladies some peace and quiet.
Coming upon one of the last cells, Max gasped ashe looked upon Mr.
Cooper, or any of the other captives taken on the day of the coup.
Max looked with interest at his father to see how he would answer.
I think you can let us in, she said, her voice layered with magic.
But may we pleaseleave now and save the congratulations for later?
Fatal injury to central nervous system, read a text on her screen.
I wont believe Artemis is out of the game until I see the footage.
You know, youre repeating yourself, said No1, wittering nervously.
But how didyou survI've if you fell  I mean jumped  into a ravine?
It wasnt real laughter anyway, it was just an outburst of emotion.
The name used to mark me out as different; now it makes me unique.
Coulter darted forward to see if Lord Roke had survI'ved the fall.
The statement was spoken with an illustrative twirl of her finger.
Vilyak stopped and looked at the two of them as they hurried over.
Finally, the earl gave one curt nod and said, All right then, Ian.
But he had given his word, sohe said that stings they should have.
The Agent sat upright, his eyes thin slivers of ice as he listened
Other times, she doesnt understand the first thing about anything.
After thinking it through, he said, Come on, I think its this way.
It may be the worst encouraging development I've ever experienced.
Not a minute later a soldier armed with a rifle came to order Mrs.
I've just spoken to my agent in Lord Asriels fortress, he went on.
Brams sparkhis soullives within me and bears witness to myvictory.
The only one you couldknow by touch would be the wiggly shaped one.
where the clues lead you  thats where youll find the next envelope!
Then you are even more foolish than I perceived you to be, said Mr.
What I cant understand is why theres no sign of her, said the earl.
We saw you guys looking through your binoculars, so we looked, too.
Then all the Ten Men looked at one another and burst into laughter.
Maybe this is it, then, said Sticky, looking around apprehensively.
himself and lion-shaped, in the hope of daunting the Gallivespians.
Reynie awoke early the next morning with a prickling of uneasiness.
worry about that, but now I seem to have a lot more to worry about.
They live on the oats and hay and other feed Mister keeps in there.
The word expenses sounded a lot more sinister when Kronski used it.
It did okay for a few years, but I think looking at those buildings
They have little dealing with the Souththey are a reclusive people.
a protective arm around Max, causing the hag to roar with laughter.
Whateverfighting must be done, I will be unable to take part in it.
Richter, forgive our ignorance, but what exactly are you demanding?
Maxs father looked clammy and bloodless; even David looked shocked.
Without you, Id still be confined within that depressing Rembrandt.
Theres something I have to do, and I might not getthe chance later.
Somehow it calmed Holly to see the commander as nervous as she was.
Someone will be here soon either the man in the suit or our friend.
You've seen where we live, now, and the barn, so lets go, she said.
I want to give you a glimpse of ourstruggle, our fight for justice!
And when I do, I never like it, especially whenArtemis is involved.
His mother used to say that someone had just walked over his grave.
Finally, when his brain had organized the data, he opened his eyes.
A moment later, they were gonevanished like so much mist and smoke.
But just because youdidnt move fast didnt mean you wouldnt arrI've.
Commander Root placed far too much value on your opinions, and look
young boy, Jaaved, but now I think I shall like to hear your story.
In his most authoritative tone which was not very authoritative, S.
How they will fall, she thought, how they will beg for forgiveness.
But the fidgety bald boy was the only one she felt confident about.
I understand you got yourself a problem with your little girl, Cam.
Anyway, Kate, dont tell us you didnt enjoy doing that, Sticky said.
Anyway, as for the second test, yes: I was the only one who passed.
Anyway, Reynie said, its in plain sight and youd surely be spotted.
Hes working on his new message, Sticky said, finally understanding.
Im given to understand that you had a rough crossing at the border.
I used magic on my mother, so therefore I probably have the disease.
Max looked hard at Astaroth, whose face was grave and contemplative.
But the frame was the original porous stone used to build the manor.
But the Chevaliers expression, as he looked at Will, was displeased.
Any child caught cheating will be escorted from thebuilding at once.
I think she might believe the world is coming to an end orsomething.
At that moment the Gallivespians, too, were talking about the knife.
They looked at the oldest man among them, as if he were their guide.
Max nodded but reached forward to give Sarahs hand a fierce squeeze.
I think, Foaly, that perhaps you do not read human expressions well.
Max was nearly tempted to chase after it, but then he looked down to
Theyd told her to go through the opening in the Oxford she had lived
I've used dangerous books before, replied his roommate with a shrug.
If anybody should know this sort of thing, it would be an Executive.
Well, I admit: the child must have some gift I've never seen myself.
I've said it before and I say it again, theres nobody like the Capn.
Because I've never seen anything like Max before, replied the Agent.
When we were alive, they told us that when we died wed go to Heaven.
What I cant understand is how my map could be in both places atonce.
Before Will could move, Balthamos said, I've decided what I must do.
To be sure, the process was slow, but so is the rhythm of our lives.
When Ians jaw fell open, the earl explained, You have to understand,
Ill be making a quick descent to lessen our chancesof being spotted.
When Milligan didnt answer, they looked at one another with concern.
Keep away from that snake, Bardo had said; that snake lives on mice.
Well have to try again tomorrow, Kate said finally, stifling a yawn.
Later, in the time of Daniel, he was agedhe was the Ancient of Days.
It seemed as though her heart was finally catching up with her body.
Forgive me, for only now do my old eyes see the light upon his brow.
Rasmussen issued soft-spoken orders while the engineers looked on in
Sure enough  just as Kate had predicted  an Executive was on patrol.
HAPPY was not a word often used to describe Artemis Fowls bodyguard.
So when its detonated, the child will be destroyed, wherever she is?
Finally he grabbed it with both hands and wrenched on the hot water.
Finally, looking satisfied, he closed his notebook and said, Got it.
Hes out in the woods somewheretheres no way hell survI've that long!
Take, for example,your female friend, the diminutive Miss Contraire.
Thatll give ye time to grub up and to catch forty winks before morn.
She looked directly at Curtis and said, Shes in bad shape, you know.
She looked desperately back and forth betweenIphigenia and Sterling.
She looked puzzled, alternating her gaze between Nick and the group.
She looked at the little curl of dark blond hair and shook her head.
She looked defiant as well as lost, Dame Hannah thought, and admired
Reynie, less fearless thanKate, had to give the matter some thought.
He blinked and swI'veled his eyes, too sleepy even to move his head.
She looked up to find she had fallen onto whatappeared to be a road.
She sprinted back through the trees until she arrI'ved at the ravine
I never met a computer nerd yet who didnt leave himself a back door.
I got my pilots licence back finally after the Mulch Diggums escape.
I promise you he wont hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant.
Howe'ver long it takes you will still be faster than we couldmanage.
I feel like everyone I come in contact with, Im ruining their lives.
I think Carlos meant, Dont fall from the ceiling and break your leg.
I suppose someone should tell you the story sooner orlater, he said.
They could understand the trapper taking some for food, but just for
There was an office pool running on how long he had before his heart
These two had done some surveillance and decided to break in anyway.
A street musician played guitar and sang near a grove ofolive trees.
The humans had congregated inthe wreckage that used to be a hallway.
The magic shifted and swirled, finally etching a picture in the air.
Everywhere she looked she could see gold, just as Atal had described
The helmet would filter out most of it, andanyway she had no choice.
Do you know why I had the space probe crash into the prison shuttle?
How long do you think it will be before they can return to the keep?
His job was to deliver the telegram to anyone on the Wetherall farm.
Do you think I might be able to convince you togive me your secrets?
And he neverwould be again if they didnt manage to board this train.
You've done it once, and next time it will be easier, Serafina said.
Yes, said Kirjava, we looked closely, and we saw what was happening.
I see a rooftop, she began, and Ian felt a tingle of disappointment.
In fact, he looked more like the skeleton in the picture than like a
And he never got to see inside a spaceship (except the cardboard-box
Yes, and I've been going nuts waiting for you to wake up, Kate said.
How do we get the Book once we've arrI'ved wherever it is were going?
Finally, Richard returned, and the van shifted again as Prue felt him
Their heads bobbed and their talons clacked as more birds arrI'ved to
We get off at the next-to-last stop, before wereach the main station.
The children, frozen in their spots, swI'veled their eyes all around.
So the Gallivespians still cannot quite trust those who are our size.
Alexandra took this moment to finally draw her sword from her sheath.
I think I should give you asedative before I administer the antidote.
A quick glance at the next few questions did nothing toencourage him.
They had been in sore need of hope, and Sticky had just delivered it.
I think there is a lot of work to be done in the field of psychology.
Prue turned the corner at the old clock and headed toward the rI'ver.
She was a brand new Executive, but alreadyunderstood far more than S.
Finally, the entire crowd chorused theirapproval, and Brendan nodded.
Max watched the First Years fidgeting nervously at the nearby tables.
Constance, who felt very desperate indeed, could not control herself.
Well be split apartand communication will be ofthe utmost importance.
Yes, replied the Elder Mystic, Ill be making my way there eventually.
Benedict, whohappened to be planning an annI'versary reunion for you.
Max swI'veled about to see the tunnel behind them engorged with fire.
He may be coming out of his shell, but hes still sensitive, you know.
Theresa, Jimmy, Annie, Janet, you stay right here, you understand me?
Dont worry about that, said Kate, with a dismissive wave of her hand.
If there is any way in which I can help you, I will be glad to do it.
He went to the window to give himself something different to look at.
She would have loved me soon enough anyway, thought Turnball crossly.
Six hours later he scurried back to theconference room for a meeting.
Combine the two and your chances ofnervousness are greatly increased.
Rats live in the barn, and there are families of mice, too,barn mice.
All around him children wereshivering, sighing, grinding their teeth.
The Governess smiled and, remembering herself, looked back at Curtis.
It used to be that Sticky couldnt bear to be looked at or listenedto.
Given the circumstances, I am going to invite others to that meeting.
He looked back to explain, I want to  But he was too sad to say more.
grandson and said, Do you know how many legs are on that stool, Arty?
Two hours later Constance came down the village path toward the silo.
McDaniels turned away from the mirror and looked himself up and down.
Finally it was over, and the priest stepped back and pushed him away.
I know what it is, said Miss Boon, and your father will be just fine.
Aye, nasties like hags, she allowed with a final, convulsive chuckle.
Everyone looked to Milligan, who was seated at the table beside Kate.
He looked at David, whose eyes had taken on the detached, glassy look
I think Im going to celebrate, he said, punching the intercom button.
Finally, with a deep sigh he said, Thank you for telling me, my lord.
Its not like thats the only ice cream container youll ever see, Capn.
All right; bright but not intellectual; impulsive, dishonest, greedy 
They had positively beamed; the entire house had felt alive andlight.
Perhaps youll give our guests a summary ofwhat we've learned to date.
Fredle huddled on the ground, shivering with terror and wet with ice 
A sick man received a visit from his doctor, who asked him how he was.
With her heartthudding like bass drums in her ears, she looked around.
Afterward Sticky said he had something to do and would jointhem later.
the hard way, though, is that the ulu has to give its blood willingly.
The two Gallivespians trembled with anger at this slur on their honor.
Prue and Macs reception, when they arrI'ved back at their house in St.
A minute later the man exited the train with the informationhe needed.
Benedict looked at his brother with an expression of profound concern.
Itwas probably a bad idea to keep Executives waiting, Sticky had said.
The next morning, they dragged Dad out of bed as soon as they woke up.
She looked upset, so much so that Hubrecht asked if shefelt all right.
RichterI think the scholars are studying it in the Archives, said Max.
When Stink woke up the next morning, his bed felt as big as a country.
Hisskin was wet with perspiration, and his lips quI'vered as he spoke.
Number Two had been given to such mushy pronouncements ever since shed
They suddenly looked to Prue like two confused and terrified children.
I think I know, said Reynie, finally recovering from his astonishment.
to me, and later I overheard bits of a conversation she had with Pati.
She looked up to see Enver, out of breath,land on top of the Dumpster.
I think itcould drI've me crazy or distract me from what I have to do.
Reynie turned his back, the better to hide his own nervous expression.
Yes, youll have to give that to one of my attendants before you leave.
Thus at any given moment, its a safe betfor me to assume you have one.
A few minutes later aresponse began flashing among the mainland trees.
Will reached the corner of the street and looked along the waterfront.
Hefinally eased into a seat to gaze thoughtfully at her tranquil face.
Current inhabitants who do not meet our requirements will be deported.
She looked at Will with pleasure, and saw him fierce and contemptuous.
So I was going into unI'versity to teach and do research into particle
Im attentive enough to see youre as nasty as ever, Constance retorted.
Indeed, they were afraid of their inability to give you a proper home.
His chest heaved, his legs were shaky, and he looked terriblyconfused.
I never knew how that oldwoman knew Mum was going to die, but she did.
The remaining horses stomped their feetnervously and whinnied in fear.
The herd ofgrazers all looked up as one and began to trot toward them.
Yet now, twelve monthsand thousands of miles later, the time had come.
From the window, said Sticky, who looked every bit as surprised as Mr.
Im wondering how many of the coonlets survI'ved the winter, Rilf said.
He looked back at Curtis and the bandits who stood by the stone altar.
He was so nervous he had no appetite, but he did try to eat something.
But he should be fine; crows are very protective of their possessions.
Seconds later, the truck made a slow U-turn and sped back up the road.
Approximately seven kilometers below sea level, responded the drI'ver.
When these have been obtained, this object will be surrendered to you.
Theresa understands Natalie better than any other little kid ever has.
He looked sharply at Theo and asked, How do you know this, sweet lady?
Coulter looked at him with an expression of mild and virtuous concern.
I used to chat with him in the kitchens until that awful hag arrI'ved.
It was so fixed and intense that he looked more like amask than a man.
Other wolfish silhouettes arrI'ved at the fringe of the burning woods.
Tell us what we want to know, he said firmly, and Ill give this to you.
Fredle looked all around, noticing everything he could, and he thought.
David said nothing but looked upon the grinning Demon with mute terror.
Juliet finally found a space opposite the Needles main revolving doors.
I think were going to make it, he thought in a rare moment of optimism.
Kates dive to the ground had sent Constance tumbling over hershoulders.
give me a plump mouse anytime, especially a plump house mouse,Rec said.
Make one move, missy, and Ill fill you full of holes, said the drI'ver.
I've gotten a lot,you know, he boasted, glancing from the knife to Max.
He shook a mist of ash from his left wing and looked haplessly at Prue.
Max stood and looked at David, who held the Book tight within his arms.
Curtis straightened his spine and looked directly into Alexandras eyes.
The shadow of the huge moose made Delph nervous and he began to fidget.
David looked back at him, tottering wearily like a punch-drunk fighter.
But they kept their distance, and the Gallivespians flew above, keeping
Finally the moment he had dreamed about for so manydecades had arrived.
Her impatience was finally winning out over herembarrassment, howe'ver.
The strange blurred section refused to be sharpened,cloned, or shifted.
A heavy mist hung over the rI'ver basin, obscuring the watercompletely.
Max felt his cheeks burn as the First Years looked at him, dumbfounded.
The ridge came alive with the crack of gunfire and the swish of arrows.
I wasnt sure if she was stillalive, much less whether shed remember me.
Special recruits often end up as Messengers, and manybecome Executives.
I've tuned the Receiver to English only because thats what weall speak.
The attach, looking away from his assistant, laughed nervously at Prue.
What I think about Piper is kind of embarrassing, to tell you thetruth.
When the attach arrI'ved at the front of the desk, the black-suited men
I should give the head honchos over there a callsuggest a slogan ortwo.
They arrI'ved soon after the American man and the pencilwoman had left.
The low hum of the crowds chatter swarmed the scene like a hive ofbees.
Hedidnt generally voice opinions without some evidence to back them up.
Coulter didnt flinch; she looked at him coolly and turned back to Will.
Printed in distinctive, awkwardhandwriting, it read: LOSE the new code?
Hed been given the job by Seamus, and he found it was oddly satisfying.
If a Ten Man delivered the pigeon, he mused, then another Ten Man could
I tap the flat part of the bedspread near what I think is Theresas leg.
Hed been here only five minutes and already felt a hundred timesbetter.
I remember how awful I feltwhenever I had to turn in my sash and tunic.
Will moveddown warily in case there was someone still alive and hiding.
She looked at Reynie and Sticky, both of them gasping and doubled over.
And, at any rate, one of the few rules the Executives seemed willing to
Ian yelled, his mind finally settling on a slight version of the truth.
Then she looked over at her friends, winked, and gave them a huge grin.
Curtis did his best to remain an active participant inthe celebrations.
Anyway, she could hardly return to shore, so inthe water she must stay.
It certainly could happen that one of the moons will be out in the sky.
Anyway, my point is, it would take several years to gatherso much iron.
The LEP shuttle finally touched down, popping a hatch on its port side.
That will be useful to you the next time we meet outside, Patches said.
When Holly and Butler finally touched down in the grounds of Fowl Manor
Please see to it that this box here is delivered safely to my quarters.
Constance growled at no one in particular, but she looked muchrelieved.
These batteries are being used to power outlawed Softnose laser weapons.
Without David, theyd still be staring at a stone door, for heavens sake!
Kronskis fingers twitched, and Artemis could guess what he was thinking.
the natives can understand a few phrases and words, added the professor.
But I've never been gotten rid of before, so its difficult forme to say.
Not as big as the dogs, but to Fredle they looked huge, and he knew that
Theheadmistress is a clever young woman, energetic, imaginative, kindly.
Seconds later he encountered the very barrier he had been saving up for.
David Menlo will be given unto them, as he should have been last autumn.

But even in that case, the cellar mice would still be talking about her.
Andit was empty; the only footfalls and the only shadows were their own.
The horsemen faded into the rearview mirror as they arrI'ved at the side

Pex, do you know what the Antonellis charge if you lose their personnel?
Connor scoffed in disbelief and looked to Max and the girls for support.
He had recoveredthe chess set, and he finally had the children cornered.
And I may be able to offer some answers now, thoughsome must come later.
Those have to be the most absolutely yawn-causing names I've ever heard.
A nursery rhyme used to teach children to sit still if they saw a human.
So far so good, I think as she pokes her head in the electric shop door.
The modern wing rigs were more complicated than he was used to, plus hed
Prue frowned, saying, I hadnt really given much thought to it, actually.
The very idea that people should have a say over where and how they live
In hispocket Reynie could feel the present Captain Noland had given him.
Finally, the tunnel opened into a massive chamber bustling withactivity.
Ian let out a huge breath when the man finally exclaimed, There you are!
As if theysuspected something, they looked all around, and suddenly Mrs.
If I've learned to respect anything, its the demands of genius, he said.
Feeling strangely nervous, Butler opened the folder with his name on it.
Enver lookedup to the sky, the dewy air of morning ruffling his feathers.
Curtis watched his fellow soldiers dive headlong into their celebrations.
It looked as if the ivy itself had been thereason for the trees toppling.
So the next thing you shrubs need to know is how to find your way around.
We arrI've at Hamburg in two weeks, so you might as well get comfortable.
Anyway, it was immaterial: a moment or two would be too late for Artemis.
He didnt have time to count them, but they lookedto number in the dozens.
Sloppy, lovelorn kissesbetween reunited husbands and wI'ves were enjoyed.
But if you will only wait a few days, my master is going to give a feast.
I needed asacrifice, and the first child to arrI've was my own daughter .
A physician and several attendants arrI'ved in a second podmoments later.
Rasmussen looked at Max with very real fear stamped on his taut features.
Curtis felt a tug at his pant leg and looked down to see it was Septimus.
Curtain erupted into laughter again, a long fit of convulsive screeching.
Given a moments respite, he glanced back to see Prue ducking her head out
They looked like a cross between antelopes and motorcycles, but they were
Finally, andagainst all the odds, Juliet managed to switch the canisters.
I think its time Mister Vassikin was introduced tomy friend, Mister Fist.
He helped herinto the seat and watched as she looked around the controls.
She stared blankly for a moment beforehazarding a response: I live in St.
And so, a few minutes later, it was Reynie who knocked on the study door.
She stared wistfully through the grate a moment, then looked up at Reynie
Was she really expected to give him up again toanother dangerous mission?
And indeed it was the sound of crowing that woke Reynie the next morning.
The fox finally continued, I suppose this would involve ringing the bell.
I never even heard that coming, he thought, and then, So much for Shammy.
Was he stalling, too, or was it the opposite had Sticky already given up?
There waiting was a small closed carriage, drawnby an anbaric locomotive.
When he sees that I see him, his head ducks down as if he wasnt watching.
Shoving the sergeants body aside, Curtis jumped up and looked around him.
Caillech scratched herhead and swI'veled to gaze at the road behind them.
He had no choice: Cooper was sick andthe only help lay in that direction.
Bob, please dont tell anyone I've woken up until tomorrow, David pleaded.
No1 looked at the nub where his previously whole index finger used to be.

His face was crimson, and his massive hands were balled into tight fists.
Teary good-byes were exchanged between sweethearts, husbands, and wI'ves.
Benedict had given them, it might be important for us to know about them.
As a token of faith, we will not cross the rI'ver till you have answered.
Moments later, Max saw Amulya Jain, the visiting Scholar, approach David.
Astaroth slid closer to the carriage window and looked David up and down.
earl, I think I should take the boy to our cottage and give him some tea.
They arrI'ved at a cave,dark but for a cluster of lanterns at its center.
Constance stopped trying to bite Stickyshand and looked down in surprise.
Her classmates looked askance at her, but at least they didnt bother her.
After studying it for a long, quiet moment, Theo mused, Now I understand.
I've never even imagined anything that tasted this sweet, whatever it is.
Reynie in particular hadinsisted they trust no one and give nothing away.
The dogs baying was a distantecho, but it was bone-shivering nonetheless.
When mydrI'ver opens the door to my car, you will hurry inside before me.
Hed been wondering how itwould feel for him to grow up without relatives.
so very good of youridiculous, but Ill never forget it as long as I live!
I've only glanced at it, and Constance and Sticky havent evenseen it yet.
Oh, I think that it is more than nothing, replied Madam Scargill testily.
He was thirsty, hungry, and alonethe three worst things for a mouse to be.
Magic that, by fairy law, was never to be used to mesmerize another fairy.

tussock of grass to tree, and finally, to a small island of grass and mud.
I think it matters little at this point, my young man, said the professor.
Thank-oo, said Mr Pickles after he had finally stretched it over his head.
Prue lookedup at him and saw that he was just as shell-shocked as she was.
They had no choice, said another student; the Executives never allowed it.
There were half a dozen groves within the area looked after by this group.
Carl must have shared his perspective, because he said, I dont understand.
Max looked closely at David, from whom heat radiated like a warming brick.
I think we can safely say for sure that Captain Short wont be coming back.
Prue looked down and saw a field mouse, calmly chewing on a split filbert.
Finally,he said, It literally translates, Young boy, Wigby, come this way 
Max gasped as the hag suddenly slipped a massive cleaver out of her apron.
Pennys eyes looked up and in an instant she saw Prue, frozen in the foyer.
Thats impossible, scoffed Miss Kraken with a definitive shake of her head.
I never thought wed still be on the island whenall the bad stuff happened.
They raced past thick pylons and stalls filled with expensive automobiles.
The Sender has discovered how to controlthe adhesive property of thoughts.
I know that what happened at Lady Arbuthnots was certainly noparlor trick.
Finally, toward late afternoon, Jaaved pointed ahead and announced, Lixus!
Hecouldnt understand why she wasnt delighted with the way things had gone.
I've only beenhere for a day and Im still kind of figuring everything out.
Judyand Stink ducked in a doorway and bent their heads over the next clue.
Its lethal point quI'vered at a pair of luminescent eyesseveral feet away.
So it was an illusion, then, said Cooper, finally easing back in his seat.
At least theremight be cheese and olives to buy, and springwater to drink.
Kate heard a derisive snort, then Jacksons voice saying, Hold on, you two.
The only dangerous thing that happens here is when those two cats come in.
She finished this fantastic monologue, compulsively, by saying, And now Im
When hisparents died, he was sent here from Holland to live with his aunt.
A couple of Executives have gone out  and now theyre all leaving together.
Allthe preparation, and Id given no thought to what Id say was in the box.
He didnt give Fatherthe time to say I dont remember giving you permission.
He put his eye to it quickly to keep the moonlight out and looked through.
All these sweet people and animals wouldnt be putting their lives at risk.
It was a bright red cargo van, and it looked like it had seen better days.
But if you adamantly refused  and onlythen  I was to give you the message.
She stirred it briskly, counting in her head till five minutes had goneby.
Biff shuffled his feet and looked about, but finally did as she commanded.
The crackling hoops of power round themfused to form a magical hemisphere.
Lyra clung to Wills arm and said, Theyve given it away now, and we cant do
So now I've done it, I can go and help Lord Asriel like I was supposed to.
He looked upthrough the rain to see how he could get back up to the field.
Seconds later, David held a perfect replica of the silverarmillary sphere.
Kate had spread the powder, Reynie had delivered the note to Milligan, and
Run first, look later, thats the rule, thats the way mice save themselves.
She was led through an open door in the wall and entered what looked to be
You dont think, do you, that your bell was given you as a reward of merit?
She may carry less than other container ships, butshes five times as fast!
Im an Executive, you know, and I understand the waythings work around here.
In truth, I think that dwarfs as a species are closer to moles than humans.
Afraid, the manstole a horse and rode as fast as he could to the next town.
Their manifold voices, chiming their cumulative battle cry, were deafening.
Dad turned onto Silver Lake DrI've, and they followed it around the harbor.
The man in the doorway glanced nervously at the tortured figure on the bed.
Shelooked back at Curtis, panting up the hill behind her, and kept walking.
When they saw the use to which he was putting their gift, they cried, Alas!
Within a short span of silent minutes, all four bandits had arrI'ved at the
Moments later he crashed hard into the rocks, where Carl had touched first.
Ifhe were waiting, then he could help; if not, then she was her own anyway.
She looked out into the room at the loitering hordes of humans and animals.
Now that we've taken down this one, we can hear the next one  the one thats
You will not know until you are on the water, and then it will be too late.
Max looked past them to where a round stonedoor was set into the rock face.
The bandits momentum came to a stop when they arrI'ved at a small clearing.
assure you it will be remedied, he added, with an appraising glance at Max.
I make them nervous, she explained, and then fell silent,staring at Fredle.
Id been watching a ferry down on the rI'ver and wasnt keepingan eye on him.
As the children chose theirseats, the Executives held a private discussion.
I never thought Id say this, but theres only one fairy for a job like this 
The Gallivespian said, My spies are with the boy and girl in another world.
The children looked at one another with expressions of relief and surprise.
She paused, thinking, before continuing: Most peopleand animalsive met were
Howe'ver, Im afraid not even my Executives know the code to my secret exit.
Anyway, it became obvious to me that I was or would be responsible for this
The nearest animal looked up incuriously and then turned back to the grass.
Hellbe the only person in my whole world that I can talk to about all this.
No, I've never seen it, and until the wars began, we had never heard of it.
But a moment later Salmakia leapt up tojoin the Chevalier, and called out: 
The Gallivespian leader said, What form do they have, these two lost dmons?
Curtains office, the guard andRecruiter quarters, and the Executive suites.
I've done no such thing, said the Demon, shaking his head with a sly smile.
Its drI'ver, the Ten Man at the wheel, saw him coming and moved to get out.
When he began, howe'ver, Constance was the only child who continued to eat.
Just radio the captain if you run into trouble, and Ill be back as quick as
He might have heard his name being called, but he wasnt about tobe diverted.
Richardsmiled nervously and said, Im sure hell be very sympathetic, General.
Of the four of them, Sticky was the only one to have a memory offamily life.
You can check on David later, said his father, trying to ease Max back down.
He got a rather nasty bump on his head, but when Ithink of the alternative .
Max shrugged, but David clucked his tongue impatiently and looked at Connor.
Maybe the people in Lyras world are the only livingbeings to know they have.
If the reply was alive, heintended to wring its neck and show it to be dead.
Curtis paused in his chewing and looked behind him; there was nothing there.
They followed Cooper at a cautious distance, passing by a great unI'versity.
If I dontlocate the cave myself in a few hours, Ill be back to check on you.
An arrow stuck there quI'vering less than a hands breadth from her left arm.
She looked up at Curtis, who was frozen in place in the center of the track.
My impression is that Curtain has Executives and Ten Men posted allalong Mr.
undergarments in therequite the currency, Im given to understand, in prison.
But the longer she looked, the more she began to see another kind of motion.
He looked back at Sticky, slumped on a cushion in a posture of weary defeat.
You have not twenty-four hours to live, said he, and I fear Ican do nothing.
It also makes me somewhat nervous and irritable, Im afraid, said Number Two.
asked Vishby, nervous in spite of the thrall rune that pulsed at his throat.
A sudden flapping of wings behindthem suggested the order had been received.
So far, no ones come forward to give witness to what the birds are claiming.
Andwith the help of his former Executives, so well placed in government, Mr.
Upon signing it, you will be unable to share any aspect of this meeting, its
Fumbling for the device Rasmussen had given him, Max pressed it frantically.
Every day and every night, at every moment, your signals will be watchedfor.
Then they talked about how easy it would be for a mouse to get up there from
But if you wish to see what I've beenhiding from you, then off they must go.
And, guess what, we wont even have to ask Jayjay to donate some brain fluid.
He lived with his parents and his two sisters just down the street fromPrue.
My problem, Risker growled, is I've had nothing but misery since I got back.
Violators will be subject to disciplinary action according to statute COC47.
Howe'ver, rather than risk a civil war, the progressives abdicated, and Svik
See you later, exPluto Hater, Stink said to Riley, and they both cracked up.
Suppressing her fear, she looked around, found Rogerslittle face, and said: 
Finally, the children were allowed to break for lunch and they filed inside.
He looked over at Sterling the fox and stared, searching for an explanation.
The flower looked perfectly real, was in excellent condition, and unlike Mr.
And there Ihave livedwithin the Sidh, waiting for the day I would be needed.
Finally, Ian asked, Did Laodamia say when these events were likely to occur?
He thought of thesilver sphere in the Archives and the hidden Book of Thoth.

Studying had been positively excruciating, like trying to read while someone
There would be tough questions asked when he finally caught up with Artemis.

When that was gone, who knew how long it would be before they hadpower again?
Finally, the dwarfs fingers locked on to the ledge of the eighty-fifth floor.
They had to live on soap and string, he remembered, but that was all he knew.
She could speak with perfect certainty given her talent for gaugingdistances.
You wouldnt dance when I piped; but now I'vestopped, you can do nothing else!
Pantalaimon, leopard-shaped, looked up atthem jealously, but he said nothing.
With a sudden twitch of her ears, the vye looked up, straight into Maxs eyes.
Over the next two days, he spoke with every officer in theenemy headquarters.
You may give the Book unto Lord Astaroth as a token of your allegiance and be
Will you tell your friends what I've said and return to give metheir verdict?
Youll grow into it, said Maksim finally, apparently unsatisfied with the fit.
He laid the tray on the table with a nervous bow, smiling at the President in
The Archives arent a little bookcasetheyre huge, and there are lots ofvaults.
Out of the corner of my eye I see Janet Trixle banging on the Mattamans door.
Curtain she hadnt cheated,for how else would she have been made an Executive?
They arrI'ved at theGap Bridge, spanning the dark void below it, and crossed.
She looked at Stink, who was walking the plank aka sidewalk bench, waving his
Only a tiny handful of Messengers have recovered, and I've worn them all out.
David looked curiously at the misshapen wedge; Nick sniffed at it and mewled.
Finally, Stanley lifted his wet face and wiped it with the back of his hands.
The singingfaltered, and some of the bearers looked around in doubt and fear.
The chickens feed themselves, and the livestockopen and close their own gate.
A moment later, he was flat on his back beneath the couch in the living room.
Prue watched her friend Curtis, wondering if she looked as changed as he did.
He and his people lived on the ice; ice was their home; ice wastheir citadel.
We must seek out not just a second opinion, but as many opinions as possible.
Benedict with another question: But how did you finallydisable the Whisperer?
For instance, we know theSender uses children to deliver the hidden messages.
He says he understands only a little bit of what we say, Thatcher translated.
Her heart sank as she arrI'ved atthe scene of Macs abduction: the playground.
heasked when he finally noticed Ian standing there with wide, horrified eyes.
How many ages do you think I've been ferrying people to the land of the dead?
As the door closed, the Gallivespian went back into the shadows and listened.
Pruewatched transfixed as the massive owl turned and nodded to his companion.
Meanwhile, Will and the Gallivespians were a little way off, talking quietly.
His outlook is marvelous and he never complains, butwe want him home with us.
Making your acquaintance is the only reason Im here, what with things as busy
She didnt like being looked at any more than she liked being asked questions.
A thickpall of fog had settled over the rI'ver valley, obscuring it entirely.
I would receive theinformation I sought, then return to Stonetown in triumph!
But he moved closer and closer to it, finally stopping outside her own house.
Apparently coyotes lived amicably among theirfellows in this part of the Wood.
The tack was left in until every drop of magic hadbeen used to heal the wound.
Shouldnt I have given my life, or at least my freedom, indefense of my Prince?
When you find them, guard them with your lives until they come together again.
They wont see yours or Wills, though,unless you teach them as I've taught you.
Max looked warily at the vyessome lean trackers, others bloated and boar-like.
Curtain would probably have kept him on, trained him intoan Executive one day.

But for me, give me a single grain of corn before all the jewels in the world!
It split light rays in two, so that when you looked through it you saw double.
Hes standing a good distance from Willy One Arm with his nervous foot tapping.
I understand congratulations on reaching yourthirteenth birthday are in order.
It was kind of a non-order, and anyway I only obey orders when they are sound.
Another shiver in the bridge spithim back onto the hard ground at Davids feet.
While they walked, Maxs rage subdued into a simmer and he finally felt capable
If shes aliveand putting together an army, no lessI gotta think that bodes ill
And finally she asked hesitantly, half-ashamed: Is this the right thing to do?
through it in the dark, and this was the only chance hed have to see it first.
Finally, the old man set the magnifying glass down and removed his spectacles.
Well, my young friends, I see youve caught yourself a very large fish, indeed.
Ama looked into the darkness farther back in the cave, her heart beating fast.
Constable to the Peoples Collective of North Wood, responded the hare proudly.
Even if hed been hungry he couldnt have eaten a bite  he felt very ill atease.
I dont understand you, Theo, said Jaaved, looking confusedly from Ian to Theo.
It looked as if the silent creature was trying to make him out in thedarkness.
Milligan said finally, clutching at his head as if someone had bludgeoned him.
Astaroth looked down at Davids unconscious face with thoughtful consideration.
Now were safely out of sight of the tower, but then I see where we have to go.
Well give those rats something to think about, too, said Angus, following her.
The supervising Agent placed the pen in his hand and gazed at him impassively.
Benedict left us and agreed to give him the rest when we got back to the boat!
Rockys fine, I didnt drop him, and theyd never have let you meet Capone anyway.
I am young enough to believe in magic and oldenough to understand how it works.
She sat up, wiping sleep from her eyes, and lookeddown toward the Council Tree.
Finally, they made one final dash and reached the relative safety of the caves.
And well take more, too, aslong as its given freely and the Demon leaves us be!
And if I do end up doing that, Ill be resentful because itll feel as if I didnt
David looked out at the wooded paths beneath them, sloping away into the trees.
Theo and I have collected enough treasure to get all of us to England, anyway, 
He wasnt about to say to them, Dont try to fool me about moons, I've seen them.
Sometime later, when the light was brighter, Balthamoss voice spoke beside him.
Lars continued reading from the dossier: Suspects: crows, coyotes respectively.
Then they will be free to leave with you as early as tomorrow morning, said Ms.
I've come to see what you prefer to do now, said McCracken, turning back to Mr.
I wonder how long it will take us to make it out of Jstor territory, said Theo.
McDaniels, Id like you to meet Mums sister, Bellagrogshe arrI'ved this morning.
To live by my own hand and to challenge all forms of authority before the code 
The nextmoment she realized the marshmallow was missing from her hot chocolate.
For all his brains, Artemis does not understand the consequences ofhis schemes.
He blinked and looked around todiscover that his dreams were, in fact, reality.
Theresa nods her head as if Ive finally said something that makes sense to her.
She looked back at Curtis and gripped his chinbetween her thumb and forefinger.
This closet is where the post office used to be when Alcatraz was an army post.
There, my boys, said he, united you will be more than a match for your enemies.
Anyway, we dont have to worry about him using the radio and tipping anyone off.
Finally,after a few more shakes and pulls on the lid, he handed it back to Ian.
Kate said, with a feeling of great relief, as if a nagging question had finally

The cubs were nervous when they all arrived at the doctors office the next day.
What Reynie had supposedwere light switches were only decorative wooden panels.
You only meant to lure me outside, where I could be snatched and used to trade.
The cold wind that shook the windows andthe gray morning light made her shiver.
Theres little doubt that it will be a long and difficult process, said the owl.
Max glanced back and saw the Red Branchin a defensive ring around the refugees.
But they knew what the truth was in the end: the only position they were in was
Here, he looked back at Prue, asteely reserve settling over his feathered brow.
The small dragon finally approached Buttons and Ssserekafter the herd had left.
If they live in the world, they should see and touch and hear and learn things.
But when Fredle woke up the next evening, he knew just exactly what he thought.
In the frenzy of the battle, she was able to slip through relatively unnoticed.
The soldiers Adams apple bobbed nervously, as if he was about to bear bad news.
I have no idea why she changed her mind, but I never question the peculiar logic
The onlyquestion was whether you would succeed in finding your beloved Benedict.
Finally, he shook his head, unable to communicate anything other than hismisery.
The lights of the Wastes on the far banks of the rI'ver flashed under the cloud.
Curtains most thuggish Executives, who had menaced the children at theInstitute.
Or Astaroth can inflict a most painful death upon us and acquire the Bookanyway.
The children waited, but Hubrecht only looked at them with an encouraging smile.
Of course, if we arrI'ved too late, we intended to comeashore and fight for you.
The only sound was that slow creak andsplash that was getting closer and closer.
responses had been mostly fraudulent, but Ho Chi Minh City had finally paid off.
I've seen them eating the same food they serve us, and were just fine, arent we?
I think about stopping by the Mattamans on the way down,but I decide against it.
It isaround this tree that the Mystics meet; it is how they derI've their power.
After theyd quieted down, Captain Noland said, Is Jorge your given name, Sticky?
Finally, with an apologetic smile and an artful twist of her arm, Kate got away.
And when the two menfinally managed to roll it over, Ians heart sank once again.
He opened his mouth to speak,reconsidered, and finally stared down at his shoes.
Johns and the rI'ver-bank, a three-mile length of cliff simply called the bluff.
She swam hard to keep warm, and then cameout and huddled on the bank, shivering.
Behind Max stretched the rI'verand the broad expanse of plain before the cliffs.
In the visitors section I see Mae Capone holding her yellow rose across her lap.
All I see is a fat imbecile, a little rat and someone with a hood over his head.
I think youre in for another rake over the coals from IA when you get back here.
For this, he or she will be compensated from thecommunity stores for labor lost.
But the nightingalereplied, Time was when I too, like yourself, lived among men.
He would, he thought, be an easier mouse to getalong with when he got back home.
Reynie replied, and with a nervous glance atRisker he said quickly, Now lets go.
They took a few steps in the world of grass and air and silver light, and looked
Let me give you some advice, said Russ, scratching a dry patch on his left jowl.
I think you can get me a demon, and I think you can do it in less than seventeen

entering the ceiling through a hole large enough for a mouse to squeeze through.
Curtain as he drew near, you are wondering why Martina Crowe was made Executive.
Jason looked much older than the last time Max hadseen himlike a full-grown man.
An eagle and a fox became great friends and determined to live near one another.
She looked around her and said, Im not quite surewhat wed be hiding from anyway.
The golden monkey put a tentative hand out to touch the paw of the snow leopard.
Imps never knew who their families were, and therefore everyone was their family.
Any verdict regarding Yuri Vilyak will have to wait, said Miss Kraken decisively.
You dont know how long I have waited for this moment, the pixiesaid, then paused.
Horrified, the Moomenhoven hurried away to the protective embrace of her sisters.
Sticky was still grumbling at her when Captain Noland arrI'ved with their supper.
David said nothing but pointed straight ahead, positively dumbstruck with terror.
And if theweapons were here, how long could it be before the Mud People followed?
It is a free and publiclibrary, so of course he is given the permission to do so.
It says here that the governments have finally reorganized themselves in response
He was a thinman with a thin face, and his cheeks positively bulged as he chewed.
Root paused to suck deeply on his cigar, the glow illuminated the purifier globe.
As soon as you arrI'ved, they set some anbaric work in motion down inthe cellars.
When I was a man, he said, I had wI'ves in plenty, but none was as lovely as you.
What will you do toyourself now for the heavy smack you have just given yourself?
At this, everyone at the table looked uncomfortably at their plates of cold cuts.
This demon is of no use to me if he is dead; do you understand, you reckless man?
It looked as if a giant mouse wasrunning along upside down underneath that cloth.
Atleast well understand what hes saying, said Carl moodily as they left the lawn.
Now, he said, I think it best that you stay exactly where you are until we leave.
When he went cautiously up to the opened door and looked out, he saw the kitchen.
An instant later the air in front of them burst into a flurryof talons and wings.
And anyway, who else would save the People if Artemis Fowl ever found them again?
Once upon a time, she said, quietly, there lived a little boy and his big sister.
If someone confronted him about it later, he would have his excuse in his pocket.
Father and son as good-lookin a pair as I've set eyes on this past age, she said.
The windows too high for one person to have looked throughwithout help, remember?
They havent invented a unit of time short enough to measure how long it will take
After speaking to the old couple by the olive grove, Father Gomez lost the track.
Miss Boon pursed her lips; when she finally spoke, her voice trembled with anger.
The taxi drI'ver stopped the car and spoke to his passengers in accented English.
The barnyard looked the same, the kitchen garden was unchanged, the same hazy sun
They lived every night of their lives in this lazy, easy way and they played with
I liked to listen to his pearls of wisdom, but now they are harder to understand.
Curtain replied, as if it were Reynie whod been given the present and nothimself.
You do remember what happened the last time the LEP went up against Artemis Fowl?
The Moomenhovens put down their things and swI'veled their heads toward the door.
I see them, said Foaly, melting the wrought-iron barriers right off their hinges.
There was noway he could sleep, anyway, not until he had figured out the message.
I think it best that we not give up just yet, said the earl, much to Ians relief.
Amidst a flurry of nervous shoutsand commands the soldiers hurried into formation.
I can neverkeep my mouth shut if I see someone being bullied or punished unjustly.
They burst from the woods, running in wide-eyed terror toward the protective ring.
He didnt think he could manage to live so close to that long, black,hissing thing.
I dont know what the Red Branch is, said David, but I've seen Vilyaks name before.
The Agents scarred and ruined face looked like a fractured mask of weathered bone.
I see, said Butler, straightening as much as he could in the cramped surroundings.
I've spent the whole morning crying,Reynie  ever since that stupid bird showed up.
And what I miss most is the sense of being connected to the wholeof the unI'verse.
She looked to the space where the trail broke an opening into the bordering trees.
I think shes going to be all right, he said, and his hand moved to the lump in his
I think I will have a little nap before I eat my pie, said Uncle Willy to himself.
At that moment, Sticky happened to be the only unhappy person in the entire group.
In fact, though, it was on the Gallivespian that she made the greatest impression.
What good would those opportunities do him if he wasnt qualified to be given them?
Except for Constance, they were the onlychildren who didnt seem happy and excited.
The black silhouette of the Kestrel looked like a toy anchored to a blue-gray sea.
His eyes were sending information to his brain, but his brainrefused to accept it.
Mum wept withgratitude, clinging to the ogres massive body like a stubby starfish.
This had been going on for some time when Number Two suddenly looked about for Mr.
but we have language and we make war and we use tools; maybe we should take sides.
Oh, give it a rest, Davie, pleaded Connor, reaching for a basket of warm focaccia.
Impressive, Reynie said, examining the hidden catch that made the lid spring open.
Overcoming her shyness, she approached Prue and sat down a cautious fivefeet away.
No offense, Carl began, but I think that old man should be called Professor Nutty.
Mum began to cry, great quI'vering sobs that soon escalated into outright bawling.
He might be livingwith Lyra, but she knew he wouldnt be able to live with himself.
Argent very much wanted to interview the children but had beenput off until later.
Your people will be sorry they didnt come out andjoin me, when the day is at hand.
Iflew high enough to see that the rI'ver goes a long way directly south and north.
And though the day was warm, the warehouse was cold, and Constance began toshiver.
He straightened and ironed the front of his jacket with a palm and looked at Prue.
They wondered why the cat that he said lived in the kitchen was to beseen outside 
I've had free run of this campus ever since this little cock-a-whoop invited mein.
Startled, Sticky looked back and forth between Constance and the note in his hand.
Besides, you arent the only child ever to have trouble with the maze, said Rhonda.
Indeed, thePeople used to live in these until they were driven deeper underground.
Prue looked out the window, watching the ebb of activity at the entranceway below.
We came here to give Lyra time to find her dmon, and then time to live andgrow up.
Reynie flipped to the next page, which showed a picture of two smiling Recruiters.
Hours of brisk walking passedbefore they finally saw the hill looming before them.
A nest was lined with soft cloths, it waswarm; many mice lived together in a nest.
Benedict nodded at each response, then looked at Reynie, who said, Were all alone.
time, all they could do was look at one another, amazed that they were both alive.
For the first time since coming into her presence, Will looked at the monkey dmon.
Inspiring credo, muttered Rasmussen dryly, but Id rather live to fight another day.
But they never had a prayer: Mulch was gas powered, they merely had wings and fins.
And with each phrase came the memory of the pleasure hed been given by thinking it.
And in Minervas opinion, her ownproblems were far more important than anyone elses.
Sometimes I think he would love someone to rob the place, just so he could see some
In a blur, Cooper leaned forward and pressed his knife against the drI'vers throat.
Sometimes Constance drI'ves me crazy, butnow I cant imagine being here without her.
It was difficult togauge whether the journal was an expensive gift or something Mr.
Speechless, Max wrenched his gaze away from the carnage and lookedout over the sea.
Hedmanaged to get the end looped once around his wristit looked to be a solid hold.
But it hadnt finished yet, and she looked back, frowning, until the instrument fell
The Institute is a highly secretive, well-guarded facility  not the usual thing for
The sun finally dipped below the horizon and Holly raised the filters on her visor.
peered at the photo and shot a startled glance at Cooper, who looked uncomfortable.
Too much important work todo, he says, broadening the minds of the next generation.
Will could see hissilhouette in the cave mouth, crouching, attentive, and then Mrs.
She learned that there were two sexes, and that they lived monogamously in couples.
Adamsson, so I think we can skip overany icebreakers you may feel obliged to offer.
Those who fail to register or attempt to leave any member country will be arrested.
McDaniels strays more than ten meters, the explosive he has ingested will detonate.
Because its main weapon was light, the fallout could be focused to an exact radius.
Alexandra watched the proceedings calmly, her eyes neverwavering from her captives.
I was born there and my parents live there, so I guess I dont really have a choice.
Well, I was going to get to that, sir, he said, walking to the drI'vers-sidewindow.
You can always tell anExecutive by the uniform  blue pants, white tunic, blue sash.
David hobbled around to join him, scratching at an impressive lump on his forehead.
Benedict started, then looked visibly upset, as if hed just received terrible news.
The dankness of the stairwell was bone-chilling, and she shivered as she descended.
But I've heard of these writers, said Max, thrusting his hands deep in his pockets.
At least he didnt seem to know what the book is, said Max, exhaling a moment later.
If that gun gets much farther, our battalion will be at the mercy of these savages.
Sneak a bowl of the stew  I wont tellanyone  but lets give them a few minutes more.
A moment later he had shot back over to the boys with a brown package in his hands.
Now that theyd been given a moment to reflect upon it, theywere deeply moved by Mr.
was enough to tell her that Artemis was not the clinical logistician he used to be.
The timing was perfect, he said, because he intended to take a research trip anyway
Finally, the cloaked figure reached up and calmly eased his hood back from his head.
Pedalian and Martina Crowe  the other Executives who had fled the Institute with Mr.
Fredle had been thinking, while his shivering slowed down to the occasional shudder.
He looked directly into Prues eyes, tears welling up at the lip of his lower lashes.
Finally she heard the door closing in the other room and roused herself to stand up.
Suddenly, the main lights turned back on; the pervasive hum of white noise returned.
The air was alive with car horns as Prue zigzagged through the steady traffic of St.
Finally, he nodded toDelph, whose tail thumped the ground in pure happiness and joy.
Theyve alwaysallowed enough through for us to live very comfortably, said Iphigenia.
Ahead, on the western horizon, clouds lay heaped and brilliant, riven with chasms of
Carl, finally free of the helmet, blinked several times, trying to get his bearings.
Buttons muttered as much to herself as to Sally, You know, I think maybe youreright.
But feelings arent evidence, and your own surveillance tapes will prove that I never
I've been promised the witches eternal gratitude if I should keep a lookout for you.
In her arms was a massive olddictionary, and her blue eyes twinkled with excitement.
I lived on earth for sixty-five years, and then the Authoritytook me to his Kingdom.
It almostlooked like a distant beacon, but Max had never seen a beacon there before.
The other, judging by the size of her head, was a tall-haired Executive namedRegina.
They both looked back at the atlas, andPrue laid her head against her fathers chest.
Commander Soolrefused to allow her to attend the commitment, even under armed guard.
Coulter was not how to get out of this situation alive: that was a secondary matter.
Apparently the pixie with the golden touch refused to pay the triads protection fee.
When you are a little older and more experienced, I haveyou in mind as an Executive.
Its the most remarkable thing I've ever heard, Reynie said, equally impressed by Mr.
When the ceiling panel slid aside that night, Kates was the only face that appeared.
Will found a man close by who looked like a teacher, and said: Do you speak English?
The great rI'ver only a short way from here used to flow north into the ArcticOcean.
Anyway, of course he liked to watch television  everybody liked to watch television.
Well, after we left you, he was killed, and it was my fault, at least I felt it was.
Well, he said, it will mean that when we join battle, we shall have a new objective.
With their leg muscles burning and chests heaving, the boys finally reached the top.
With the knife in his right hand, Will balanced himself carefully and looked around.
As soon as they were out of earshot of the Presidents room, the Gallivespian sprang.
Benedict caught her, held her by the shoulders, and looked her squarely in the eyes.
His gaze flitted from face to face; his authoritative voice filled the lecture hall.
Okay, he said finally, I might not have been totally straight with you onthat front.
Nicholas Benedict isan old friend of mine, and I've heard a good deal about you all.
The line moved quickly, each bandit peeling away when theydreceived their allotment.
give them a minute to catch their breaths, she said, giving Max an apologetic shrug.
The engine hummed to life andhe reversed up a long, twisting drI've of patchy gravel.
He wanted togive her a comforting look, but she wouldnt even glance in his direction.
Given Rowans professed need for itsacquisition, I think our price is very reasonable.
The Society thinks that your daughter is the most important child who has ever lived.
Man,every single part of me is aching to join the rest of the living unI'verse again!
Reynie looked at Constance, who by way of answering Sticky was poking her tongue out.
I've got a job to do, said Richard, gesturing to the piles of mail in the cargo hold.
Sticky looked confused and started to ask Reynie something, but Milligan shushed him.
A few students milled about in the rock garden, but there were noExecutives in sight.
A moment later the orderly arrI'ved with a tray ofbread, cheese, and coffee, and Mrs.
A few fresh beads of sweat had collected on his massiveforehead, threatening to fall.
I dont want news of these shenanigans to go farther than this room, do you understand
We cant seem to get her to understand that full moons happen nomatter where you live.
The Executives started making their way down the lines, collecting the paper figures.
coppery quills on Nicks belly until the rat wandered off and Nick finally went still.
I think that perhaps you were far from blameless, my dear, but I was blinded by love.
Once inside, he looked upon a broad courtyard where a single ancient oak was planted.

We understand, Professor, said Ian solemnly, pulling his aching arms in front of him.
They do the job, said one of the Helpers, a short rotund man who looked rather like a
Constance, who now felt very ill indeed, said irritably, You know its possible, Kate.
Fredle finally answered her, in a faint, whispery voice, as small as an ants, Nobody.
Prue walked around to the side of the van, and the drI'ver opened it from the inside.
lives up in the rafters and our nest is way at the back, in the bottom layer of wood.
Tialys and Salmakia mounted their dragonflies and held them quI'vering on the ground.
Max looked at the other objects on the dais and came to a sudden, sinking conclusion.
Curtain regarded the captive children as if contemplating a magnificent piece of art.
Dwarfs didnt have much power anyway, and casting spells had always made him nauseous.
He looked upon the man as his friend, and they shared the cave forsome time together.
Evidently satisfied, the eagle ruffled his feathers and looked behind him at Richard.
She looked back up at themilling children, the sitting Mystics, and the looming tree.
Now that the shotgun was no longer at his eye, Prue had a better view of the drI'ver.
hand was shaking, and his fingers were bleeding again; he looked as sick as she felt.
Nothings foolproof, but I promise I've doneeverything I can to avoid tipping him off.
What happened when the cons triedto escape changed the way we think about each other.
Ian got to his feet to make room for the old man as he finally crested the flat rock.
And yet, three livesno matter how blessedare but a pittance to preserve mans freedom.
Im such a young Executive, I can still do Messenger work in a pinch, Martina boasted.
I see no way to sabotage the process itself, so I must ensure that something survives
His thoughts were interrupted by Stickys nervous voice crying out: Sticky Washington!
He looked directly at Curtis, his steely blueeyes catching the flicker of the candle.
The creature howled and thrashed as she fell into the mud, and the nearest one looked
Anyway, Reynie thought, if nothing else comes of this, at least youre making friends.
With the others peering over his shoulder, Reynie flipped through the next few pages.
Reynie shivered and glanced at Sticky, who was just tucking away his polish-ingcloth.
If that was a vye, then I've got little doubt they were looking for us, specifically.
Kate heard him and looked back, which was exactly the worst thing she could have done.
They went back to the rock, and Will said to the Gallivespians, Im going to sleep now.
He already knows your first name and, truth be told, I think hes a little fond of you.
Theyre talking about Theo, he whispered, and Ian felt a nervousshiver run through him.
Well, that was when I discovered that Nicholas is the mostpersuasive man in the world.
They were marched across the plaza, down a walkway, and finally over a patch of grass.
Finally, the glare subsided, and with a hand over his brow, he was able to lookaround.
We made our way toIreland, where he led me to a door on the banks of the rI'ver Boyne.
The man looked serious, but his eyes displayed an obvious satisfaction, even pleasure.
Minutes later, Max surveyed the six grisly bodies piled near the edge of the clearing.
Im going to wait until I see her leave,and then Im going to dig her hole into nothing.
Brendan gave a quiet stutter of a laugh, the first show of emotion since hed arrI'ved.
Long time since I've been down here, he sniffed, seizing the ring and pulling it open.
I've been through dozens of these, she said, holding the magnet up for them to admire.
When a queasy-looking Executiveapproached to ask their business, Kate cried, Get back!
And finally, herds of creatures, too far off to see distinctly, grazed on the prairie.
I've been feeling uneasy about something, Reynie said, and I just realized what it is.
Lets not give up just yet, said Reynie, hoping Constance hadnt heard what Sticky said.
Lyra thought of waking him up, but if she was onher own, she could swim in the rI'ver.
He looked out again at theapproaching armada, its progress now steady and uncontested.
Apparently satisfied the fight was over, the Agent tapped a small receiver in his ear.
Well,he would have to deceive her in turn: hed have to make her think he was harmless.
Well, this is a mystery, said Farder Coram, and Im glad I lived long enough to see it.
When she spoke this time her voice was quite gentle, and she looked Reynie inthe eyes.
In half an hourhe arrI'ved, weary and wet, at a path on the far side of the Institute.
I just felt it imperative that you understand what kind of people you are dealingwith.
I have no doubt that you will be able to navigate these issueswith courage and wisdom.
The other students giggled, but Julie looked mortified and merely staredat the ground.
Theo hadnt had another attack; her powers of sight were simplyworking as they used to.
The outline of a man seemed toquI'ver in the light, and the air was thicker inside it.
Magus knelt and bowed low to the fireplace as he said, I seek only to serve you, Sire.
A second later she had unlocked the handcuffs and lowered them silently to the ground.
The childs voice never faltered, never ceased, but delivered the curious phrases in an
The Assistant Pirate at the art store handed over three more coins  and the next clue.
He andthat nervous-looking woman came here on the same morning they went to the castle.
I dont know how you can talk to me about survival instincts when you live with a snake.
This name is secretit is what gives a thing shape andspirit and binds it to this world.
Max gasped at the sight of two massive shedu flanking a tall door of shining brass that
We need to getcloser, or I could send the detonation signal anyway; we might get lucky.
Bel, hissed Mum, you shouldnt be snooping around the campusthe Archives are off-limits.
Max paused a moment, crouched in a defensive posture while he considered Coopers offer.
And Pantalaimon said, Oh, Lyra, forgive us, but we have to tell you what we found out .
Surely you meant that as a request and not some sort of primitive threat, Agent Cooper.
Max looked hard at his father, whose eyes were shining likethose of a happy little boy.
About dmons, and how they can onlylive for a long time if they stay in their own world.
I've been closer to the heart of the Magisteriumthan anyone youre likely to find again.
Upon hearing the request, Bob stood to his full height andlooked down his chest at Max.
So many species were givenshort shrift by the Svik rule of law; much recompense is due.
Go farther along the road tothe left and give these papers to the official at the gate.
I've already said well give you the papers, Reynie said, speaking with some difficulty.
He hadnt eaten since the evening before, and it wasnow  well, what time was it, anyway?
I dont think I've ever seen anyone so sad as Milligan, but these two cameawfully close.
From this height they looked like insects, eagerly massed at the entrance of abug trap.
And anyway, the demons cant even fully materialize unless we shoot them full of silver.
I wish you could come live with us, Neldo said, but they both knew that wasnt possible.
Reynie and Sticky spent the rest of the morning looking nervously over their shoulders.
Twenty minutes later, Max and Cooper stood among the treasures of the Red Branch vault.
As she looked through, she saw a swarm of golden sparkles surrounding the form of Atal.
If I hadnt become a writer, I think I would have continued as a primary-school teacher.
Finally, the assistant at the attachsside leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
Its the happiest I've ever been, said David, uncovering a basket to offer Max an apple.
He pulled the shotgun back into the cab of thevan and looked behind him, down the road.
When the group finally reached the castle, they wasted no time getting out of the cold.
The blood will revI've the slumbering plant and make it subject to the Governesss will.
She looked tired; there were bags under her eyes and her hair was tangled with bedhead.
I think Ive got her now, but when we stop laughing she walks the rest of the way up the
Down and down he went, lost in his thoughts, until the elevator finally came to a halt.
They arrI'ved at the Gap Bridge and crossed, none of them besides Curtis giving so much
A squirrel popped its head from behind a rotted treestump and looked at her quizzically.
Soon, winter would arrI've with its steady gloom of rain and the occasional fall ofsnow.
The next few entries are allabout using children as filters to keep the messages hidden.
You must come and stay with me,and I promise you, you shall live on the fat of the land.
five days later, Max stood on the banks of the rI'ver Tormes and contemplated Salamanca.
He must be so oldive never seen anyone suffering like thatoh, Will, cant we let him out?
But sooner or later, she would reappear and once again be attacked by the small terrier.
Finally, the mass of people began to move as a figure forced its way through the bodies.
Curtis shivered and sat down on the floor of his cage, squeezing his knees to his chest.
We arent going to the bay forest, Reynie said, and the others looked at him in surprise.
Anyway,if he just turned around and left, he cant have meant to do anything bad, can he?
He took out the knife and looked into the eyes of his fathers ghost, who stood close by.
nothing soothes the mind more effectively than a simple answer to a complicated problem.
The only sound was that of the flickering torches as David pored over its many pages and
Sooner orlater her, adversary would appear, and, then, only then, would the terrier act.
Or, if you prefer, I can wait for the others to regain consciousness and give me a hand.
Like Reynie he was every bit as wistfulas he was nervous, and for much the same reasons.
Oh, you cant conceive the horror of that moment, I hope you never suffer as I did then .
Mum dissolved into more quI'vering sobs, punctuated by a sudden explosion of flatulence.
I've sworn allegiance, as a general of the Avian army, to the throne of theCrown Prince.
A fairy expression that Artemis was not familiar with, but he could guess what it meant.
I've taught you some witch-lore,which would be forbidden under the old ways in my world.
Well, he would only lose an advantage that he never expected to have in the first place.
The boys mind grew more receptive, the Whisperers wrinkledmessages straightened, and Mr.
Will drew himself behind the massive bole of a cedar, and looked where she was pointing.
And so climbing to his feet he said, Next time Ill give you a better run for your money.
Will felt his whole being quI'ver under the blows of the stone hammer in the bears fist.
Now that the children finally knew some things, they all rather missed not knowing them.
I think that my little sister may still decide to pick a less dangerous profession, like
My given name is Semyon, and the name of my father was Boris, so I amSemyon Borisovitch.
Before long Ian was ducking low, and then so was Jaaved, and finally Theo was bent over.
Once he stood at the foot of the throne, the man extended his hand to receivethe weapon.
Max looked down and saw a tall glass of lemonade resting on a coaster at his right hand.
He paused and looked down at his uniform, at the tornfabric where his brooch used to be.
I thoughtwe could live here, but we can live more easily in the sea, even if it is warm.
Suddenly, for no reason Will could see, both angels looked up and in the same direction.
Since becoming flat, Stanley had grown used to traveling long distances in small spaces.
They arrI'ved at a large, comfortable kitchen with frescoed walls, cascading plants, and
He could now identify one of the smells as chicken, but that was the only familiar odor.
Welearn the human ways so we can better understand them, and so more easily defeat them.
He cut a thin sliver and found it chewy and very slightly salty, but full of goodflavor.
Helooked back to Constance and saw the realization hit her, her eyes widening with alarm.
Im afraid I dontunderstand, said Thatcher, pulling their attention back to the professor.
All right, said Lyra, quite happy to be moving again, with Pan and Will, alive and awake.
She shrugs, her eyes focused on her trousers, which I see she is wearing under her dress.
King Iorek, he began, my knife is broken Then he looked past the bear and said, No, wait.
And it would be their secret, and they could go through whenever they chose, and live for
Or you may spurn my lords friendship and our servant will simply deliver the Book himself
She wondered what would happen if she looked through two pieces, one on top of the other.
Youll drift apart, its true, but youll be out in the open, part of everything aliveagain.
And not only were there people everywhere, thereseemed to be olive trees everywhere, too.
With a sudden massive effort he flung himself sideways, freeing one wingand crushing Mrs.
Now they are leaving their kingdom and sailing up therI'ver, who knows what they will do?
Lined with doorways, it stretched off into the distance, whereit finally turned a corner.
As she arrI'ved at the middle section of the bridge, she looked over the edge and gulped.
No, but if Lyra returns to her own world, then I will be her sister as long as she lives.
I've got a message from Vilyak, whispered Connor, his ruddy face becoming deadly serious.
nervous; after all, he was heading back to the very place criminals had nightmares about.
Dmitri, his sentencetemporarily commuted, let out a rush of breath and looked around him.
He swI'veled as he spoke, but wasstopped short to see that the road behind him was empty.
Willyou live long enough to see the world again, before you die and come back as a ghost?
But matters had obviously worsened, andthe children had only just arrI'ved on the island.
She looked about nineteen and was dressed in avery old-fashioned-looking apron and dress.
This type of inspection always discomfitedthe two dogs, but they were getting used to it.
Sticky laughed  a bit nervously, it seemed to Reynie  and said, I know lots of languages.
Finally they came to a large, cavernous opening where a few coyote soldiers milled about.
Doktor Rasmussen sendet Gre, said the drI'ver, glancing nervously at the approaching vye.
Woman and dmon got down from the craft and looked around to see which way they should go.
There will be too many questions, and theres no guarantee theyll give it to us, said Max.
They looked from him to the dead bird, from that tothe rifle, from the rifle to his face.
Lyra didnt want to look, but Will went to see if the man was still alive and needed help.
Thats where I've been and you can see that I've survI'ved, so whatabout if I did go back?
Max swI'veled the board down and raised it once again to reveal the dark staircase below.
Anyway, I can lower you all down the chute with my rope, and then Ill come downafter you.
You Outsiders, said another bandit, one who had remained silent during all the invective.
It took a moment for the children to realize that Constance had arrI'ved with the others.
After seeing the look of alarm in Thatchers eyes, Ian trailed the schoolmaster nervously.
Luckily for him, he hadnttaken many steps before he looked up and sighted two cats ahead.
Im quite sure I dont know what youre talking about, the drI'ver replied in a steady voice.
Ian resisted the urge to fidget nervously while Thatcher asked, You recognize the writing?
smiles again as if he has a whole lot of smiles and he wants to make sure I see every one.
Two weeks later, Bellagrog was holding court, as she was wont to do in the late afternoon.
Last time, youll recall, you betrayed me, which is the only reason you caught me offguard.
By the time he arrI'ved back at his room, he noticed that the door was ajar by the tiniest
Rose curtains had replaced the sun-worn blue ones that used to hang heavily in the parlor.
Finally, the professor held up the box and studied the four balls that served as its feet.
He didnt know how long he had to live, either, and about that he had no way to even guess.
Coming and standing under the tree he lookedup and said, What a noble bird I see above me!
Thankfully, lunch arrI'ved early, and they were coerced back to the table with the promise
He looked to Ssserek, then to Sally, and finally to Buttons, where his attention remained.
I almost think I see her smile thenas much of a smile as you ever get from Natalie anyway.
Max whirled to gaze at Caillech, who looked old and broken as she leaned against the dais.
The dawning light was pervasive now, crowning the tops of the fir trees with a goldenglow.
several eminent linguists of the opinion that this was how the common noun had originated.
And the Gallivespians,Tialys on Wills shoulder, Salmakia on Lyras, were calm and watchful.
He hadnt slept since the missile attack in Germany, and he wasnt as young as he used tobe.
If you arent the mosttalented child I've ever known, then I've never known a child at all.
Abruptly, Ians thoughts were interrupted as he listened to the nervous murmurs around him.
Then Ians eyes fell on Jaaved, still holding the cloth hed used to shine his uncles sword.
He jumped to help him, sensing that Professor Nutley might not beas spry as he used to be.
When Will heard her footsteps on the path, he looked at the spies and said, Dont you move.
She stared with wide, disbelieving eyes, first at Ian, then at Theo,and finally at Jaaved.
Now shell be safe, he thought, and a second later he saw the pale gleam of the window deep
The door through which youentered is the only door, and I am the only one who can open it.
Still, thealethiometer indicated her clearly, although of course it couldnt give her name.
One of the birds hopped to the edge of the roof and cocked its head inquisitively at them.
When Max arrI'ved at the rows of First Year tables, he immediately regretted his decision.
No one can decipher it, and yet it holds the power to snuff our lives and shape our fates?
These trees were smaller versions of the tall trees near the house, where squirrels lived.
He felt his entire future, indeed his entire character,depended upon the next few moments.
Their lost lives, their lost families  something inside them missed those things terribly.
I think it might make hersick again to ask her about what she was seeing and Id rather not.
An hour later, Miss Boon sat up and hissed, disrupting the hypnotic squeak of the oarlocks.
Coast is clear, Sticky said when hed climbed onto the television and looked out the window.
McDaniels looked like a sleepy bear, warm and content in his nightshirt of striped flannel.
Constance stared at the sharp pencil behind the Ten Mans ear, and her lip began to quI'ver.
Finally, she seemed to gather her composure and came into the room to sit down next to Ian.
Minutes later, he was regretting even thinkingsomething nice about the centaurs technology.
Before departing, Max looked back to see the great hound settling once again at Lughs feet.
There was a long pause, a tap-tap-tapping of fingers on a hard surface, and finally agrunt.
I've already said I believed the others lostthere was nothing else I could do, he muttered.
As much as Moon loves getting surprises, she loves trying to guess what they are even more.
Of course, said the young Mystics instructor, swallowing hard and gazing across the rI'ver.
I have a few days more to live, said Tialys, and the LadySalmakia a little longer, perhaps.
Instead of laughing, as Reynie had expected, Sticky slipped back into his nervous behavior.
Oh dear, I know youll give me the papers, said the Ten Man with an expression of mock pity.
Theyve grownoverprotective, Im afraid, and can hardly stand to leave me alone for a minute.
He took the Star from Theo, gave it back to Jaaved,and asked, You can understand us, right?
He looked back up, crestfallen, to bear witness to the captains escape into the underbrush.
When we get down to the waters edge I see Trixle walking across the dock, bullhorn in hand.
For allthey know, the messages might be my own invention, generated by the Receiver itself.
I miss Maya and the Archives, David said, peeping from beneath the arm flung over his face.
Turnball took a halting step, nervous as a teenage elf about to take his first moon flight.
Finally the door opened farther, very slowly, and the young priest Brother Louisstepped in.
I receive a phone call from him, and he tells me that he only took what was rightfully his.
To cross it, they had to first check in at a guardhouse, and Reynie was nervous despite Mr.
It was an extremely unpleasant sensation even for someone used to expelling large amount of
Hes probably sailing down the rI'ver rightnow on a raft, having a big, fat, newt adventure.
She was the most graceful human theGallivespian had ever seen; this clumsiness was feigned.
The next moment, the two angels were embracing, and Will, gazing into the flames, saw their
Out of nowhere a seagull flew down with a wild cry and seized the Gallivespian in his claw.
Iggy finally broached the issue because his curiosity was as long as his patience wasshort.
Maxs instinct was to step away from the knife, but David looked positivelygreen and wobbly.
Oh, Prue, if you live to be as old as I, youll see many, many strange and wonderful things.
The cavern was alive with thechaotic sound, the metallic clang echoing through the chamber.
Rhonda Kazembe looked amazed, and Reynie once again felt the weight of loneliness upon him.
Well, I've seen Lyra now, Will said, and shes alive, thats clear, and shes safe, I suppose.
The witches representatives here in Spain, replied the old Agent, pouring himself a coffee.
Max nodded but kept his eyes on their drI'ver, who returned his glare with a defiant scowl.
A little dirt never hurt anyone, but if theres water andive got something to eat, I wash it.
As Jackson was talking they came to the next platform, where a train was about to pull away.
One of the reasons he made such a fine commanderwas that he respected his officers opinions.
It mustve been pure coincidence, anillusion that he looked up into her window, nothing more.
Anyway, the plan is that I break in here, and then my partner encourages you to accompany us
When it reached the lowest level, the drI'ver accelerated smoothly toward a dead end of gray
He had a simpler nature; he looked up to Balthamos as to the fount of all knowledge and joy.
No, I needed to give you time before revealing this to youandbelieve me, I was intending to.
A single drop will make you answer questions truthfully, but its only effective fora minute.
I've caught him spying on us, and last night he slipped out during dinner tocheck the radio.
Sorry, she finallysays as Theresa comes in, her hands on her hips, her mouth ready to burst.
He wanted to be irritated, but found that he was so relieved to be alive he could onlysmile.
I dont know what the next age would be like, said Max, steering Honk back toward his mother.
Both the Director and Rowans executive council disavow allknowledge of his plans or actions.
A moment later the door opened, and Sticky entered the roomwith the pencil woman behind him.
Finally, he traced the rune on No1s forehead with a finger, to make sure it wasntpainted on.
That would be as if Fredle could shrink from a whole mouse to, for example, half a mouse and
Perhapsonly a very few  perhaps they would all be given out before he even reached the door.
They were waiting to be called out by an Executive  called away for their secret privileges.
If not for Miss Perumal he might even have given it up by now, to avoid some of the teasing.
Thats a direct order, Short, so take that insolent look off your face, its making menervous.
Then he cleared his throat nervously and went on: I may speak entirely freely in this court?
But mice dont live alone, either, and house micedont go outside, so so much for those rules.
five minutesearlier and I could have spared you that encounter  and spared myself the worry.
Then thedebtor fetched a sowthe only one he hadand took her to market to offer her for sale.
Only three weeks have passed here sinceDavid and I left, but I've been gone for a long time.
When I finally get out of bed, I have raised welts in wild irregular shapes all over mybody.
The scientist took the little envelope containing Lyras hair and bowed nervously as he left.
Because they live far on the other side of my village and they are very poor, Pagdzin tulku.
Ian finally held up his hand and stopped on a slope just beyond the castles large back wall.
She nods vigorously, like shes relieved somebody finally appreciates this important concept.
The problem, of course, was that he had received them already and was, in fact, wearingthem.
Reynie looked at Constance, whose face was even more sullen than usual, and fearful as well.
A moment later Sticky cried out in the darkness, and Reynie heard Kate ask, Did I scare you?
I dont understand it, Miss Koboi, he said, twiddling the top button on his crimson lab coat.
Besides the castle, this is the only place in the city that we know isconnected to Benedict.
He seemed inno particular hurry to give chase, but he did start moving in Reynies direction.
Foaly stamped a hoof, which was an irritated tic of his and the reason he never won at cards.
The drI'ver drove them past a government building and on a circuitous route through the city.
Yes, said Jifaar, clearly not understanding why that might mean so much to the three of them.
The pencil woman answered, Yes, if a sharpener should become necessary, one will be provided.
Finally, the crack of a broken tree limb in the brackenannounced the approach of their enemy.
And beside Reynie in the backseat, Kate andSticky were catching each other up on their lives.
The Governess looked at her askance, before striding the short distanceto the waiting Plinth.
An olive tree taunted a fig tree with the loss of her leaves at a certain season of the year.
They looked almost identical; dark olive skin, bright blue eyes, and close-croppedblack hair.
Constance lowered her hands and looked at Reynie with a mixture of ruefulness and irritation.
Anyway, the manor was avirtual fortress and had already seen off an entire LEPretrieval team.
But if we kill them, others, who have no experience, will be set to slaughter us, and will by
Two hours later, Max emerged from the chamber to find the monitoring room filled with people.
She would be shredded, passed through the machines innards and finally laid as a paving slab.
And when Sophie, doubtful, sat down again, he murmured, You two can fight all you want later.
Anyway, their shape, and the roads, and the wheel trees coming together all made it possible.
To abandonher and live with Lyra, even for the few years theyd have togethercould he do that?
With a frown Risker wiped dripping water from his eyes, blinked a few times, andlooked again.
The point is, you couldnthear Benedict shouting, and I've no doubt he upset himself to sleep.
Finally, one of the warriors came over and held out his handto Theo, barking an order at Ian.
But its been given you, and it will be up to you to decide whether its a blessing or a curse.
She soon realized that the sound was instead the collective rustling of a hundredbirds wings.
If you wanted to divert a mighty rI'ver into a different course, and all you had was a single
No more than two seconds later, the aircraft was already vanishing from sight in the damp and
In fact, I thinkhe likes you, or anyway he admires you, or at least he doesnt understand you.
Max heard the gurgle ofwater and saw a broad rI'ver shimmering across a gently sloping plain.
He looked under the table and around the refrigerator, and finally found herbeside the stove.
I think about throwing a rock, but I cant get near one with SevenFingerss arm around my neck.
No matter how noble the purpose, as you say in your letter, no matter how many lives might be
Lyra put her hands to her head, and Will nearly stumbled, as if driven downward by the sound.
Jackson looked the children overand shook his head, as if he rather doubted that possibility.
He looked at the sign again,and after a moments consideration, he laughed and shook his head.
He looked closely at the Himalaya, but he could see nothing like the map Baruch had sketched.
And a few minutes later, when the children were gathered on the hilltop, hedusted them again.
I've alwayswondered about that  when Im in the Whisperer they seem to have gone away forever.
He had big,nervous eyes like a horses, and, for some odd reason, a perfectly smooth bald head.
The Governesss army will be marchinginto the lowest levelit was some sort of gathering square.
Prue climbed aboard the carriage, sitting down next to the Elder Mystic on the drI'vers bench.
A few minutes later, Judy came rushing out of the restaurant, waving her place mat in the air.
Welcome to Frankfurt, said the drI'ver, accelerating past several cars with diplomatic plates.
He helped her up, and for the first time they looked around at the land where the ghosts were.
Finally gathering her courage, she walked over to the spot where the stairway began and stood,
Two pots, one of earthenware and the other of brass, were carried away down a rI'ver in flood.
He held a gnarled yew bowin his gloved hand, its sinewy string still quI'vering from the shot.
Make for the top of the cliff, said the dragonfly rider, and give yourself up to the Africans.
A few other kids said they were sorry but they didnt want to be late, and one boy evenlaughed.
Max looked down at Nick, whose otter-like face was uncharacteristically serene and thoughtful.
Jaaved didnt respond right away, but after a moment he said, I never learned to speak English.
Ssserek took in a deep breath as he watched Buttons with both amusement and deepunderstanding.
They tasted bitter but he ate them anyway before he set off again,back to the raccoons burrow.
He took the account from Reynie and looked it over ruefully beforestuffing it into his pocket.
Lets get you settled, then, said Rasmussen, dismissing the drI'ver and steering David forward.
The two dashed off to dinner, where David proved to be absent for a seventh consecutive night.
Iorek gathered his balance, looked around to see how the land lay, androared to the children: 
If the city of Stonetown was a busy place, its port  Stonetown Harbor  was positively frantic.
The next morning, a Moomenhoven hurried past Max with a swish of her cow tail and a shy smile.
Meanwhile, Miss Perumal her arms crossed protectively over her ribs had come over to hug Kate.
Carl was the last to stop giggling when he finally realized that the headmistress was present.
Reynie spent the next couple of minutes looking anxiously south, then north, then south again.
live redwood trees and sequoias rose hundreds of feet in the air, creating halos of shade from
When they arrI'ved at the bridge, Max and David gazed up at the white walls looming over them.
But an old dog came up to him and said, The fewer airs you give yourself the better, myfriend.
By ourselves Kate mostly meant Reynie, and she and the others instinctively turned to him now.
Moreover, the air outside had changed color and in the distance it now looked a darkgray-blue.
Once, in these quiet groves, Brendan began in a resonant voice, a great civilization thrI'ved.
I personally have put my share of a seasons harvestup as reward for his capture, dead or alive.
That poison, Lyra said, turning back to the Gallivespians, in your spurs, I mean, is it deadly?
The men were Mafiya enforcers and were more used to spending their evenings inside stolen BMWs.
She felt as soft and light in his arms as she had when Lyra was conceived thirteen yearsbefore.
He also understood, from having lived among the raccoons, that one chance was all he would get.
Moments later, others began to join in, by twos and threes, until their shrill voices split the
Far above,ravens circled the silver-tipped spires, dipping now and again to give a hoarse call.
BY the time Mulch and Doodah landed outside Tourrettes sur Loup, the dwarf was a nervous wreck.
She paused for a moment as a new flurry of witnesses arrI'ved, swelling the crowd considerably.
He had bright red cheeks and agoatee so thin and small it looked like a thumbprint on his chin.
Schuyler turned to give Sophies hand a comforting pat, but Sophie quickly withdrew her hand, so
Frowning, Max stepped decisively over to the cauldron and reached inside for the Spear of Lugh.
I think, Minerva, he said, hunkering down beside her, that we have gone too far in this matter.
Then he said, Sinceyou and I are in like case, shall we not do well to marry and live together?
Dawn arrI'ved with a steel-gray sky and a sporadic drizzling of sleet that rattled on the roof.
Finally, Fra Pavel, said the Inquirer, tell us what you know of the childs present whereabouts.
He sat several paces away from them, with his back against the only stalagmite in the clearing.
I think someones in denial, said Holly, focusing a tight beam from her Neutrino at the ceiling.
Piper asks when she and Annie finally make it outside, giddy and flushed from all theattention.
Were accompanying this boy and girl to make sure they arrI'vesafely in the care of Lord Asriel.
And I think that her fury with Ian was instigated by hernatural instinct to protect her litter.
A fox invited a stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup.
Max blinked and looked upon a great black wolf with pale yellow eyes and a red, lolling tongue.
As we speak,both boy and girl are asleep; I spoke to the Chevalier Tialys not five minutes ago.
Moments later, a largewhite truck eased into view, kicking up a fine cloud of dust in its wake.
He stopped and looked at the rough cloth that his father had bound around it after their fight.
Since what happened with the secret passageway, it has been uncomfortable between Jimmy and me.
And were both in trouble, andif that doesnt give us something in common, I dont know what will.
Madam Scargill looked from Ian and Theo to Searle, and then to Landis as if to ask his opinion.
After all, his father had been undeniably different on the day he had finallycome back to them.
The Executives circled her more warily now, looking for the right moment to renew their attack.
Court and give them the intention craft as an earnest pledge of good faith, and then shell spy.
He looked down, his expression distracted and impatient, but full of excited satisfaction, too.
And so I urge you strongly to consider what mightconstitute a new life  a life as an Executive.
They probably hadnt thought it necessary to destroythe sensitive information contained in them.
The Gallivespians bred these creatures carefully, andeach clans insects differed from the rest.
And thats why they didnt respond to oursecond message  they had to make sure we looked for him.
David nodded and shivered, rubbing his arms as the suns last rays began to fade at the horizon.
He hadnt known it at the time, but looking back on the encounter later he hadsuspected as much.
Ian and Carl scooted to the bow of the boat, anxious to help tie it up when they finally docked.
He was a stout boy with braces soheavily rubber-banded that his mouth looked like a cats cradle.
In the next few days she learned so much that she felt like a child again, bewildered by school.
The Agent broke the bar into pieces and doled them outeven Nick received a small wedge, which he
Lyra wascharged with it already, and plied the Gallivespians with questions: how did Roger seem?
The only noise the children heard was the jingle of their handcuffs for theywere all shuddering.
Reynies throat tightened, and he glanced at Sticky, who looked as if hed been stung by a hornet.
Prue fell into a kind of raptmeditative state and began to lose her sense of direction entirely.
Augur froze and looked back as a small procession came up the aisle ina merry jingling of bells.
She hadnt been squirming from nervousness  shed been twisting her legs up toget at the licorice.
Sounds like he looked in the mirror and saw himself, then decided he was not himself, said Kate.
Ah, same idea I see, said Mr Emblem, who was carrying a box of big round balls of elephant dung.
Ill fight you, in single combat, cried Will, and if you give way, then the fighting has to stop.
Lyra looked down at her, anguished; but then she stepped over her mothers body and loosened Mrs.
The small Scottie still had herbaby teeth, but she never hesitated to use them as everyone knew.
A better man I've never known  and this despite allmanner of ill fortunes, as you children know.
Miss Perumal and her mother in the farm truck, but Reynie said he expected them to arrI've soon.
She found the idea of standing po-faced at theshoulder of some opinionated politician appalling.
Prue turned back to the hill, gazed up at the looming barrier of trees before her, and shivered.
Some of the soldiers, hearing childrens voices crying out from close by, looked around startled.
For the twentieth time, Constance, Sticky said, his expansive mood greatly diminished, Im sorry.
She wondered if shed ever get out alive; but it wasintoxicating, to speak like that to this man.
When I did swallow it and looked at the man across the table, I could tell he knew something had
If you hope to see either of them again, you will give meexactly what I wish, and without delay.
Not only didNatalie understand exactly what was going on, but she figured out something I hadnt.
You know what, he muttered to himself in case Rawley could hear, I think Im going to the volcano.
They arrI'ved at the munitions tent, a large canvas structure nestled up against the ravine wall.
Still, as they walked out into the orchard, Sticky looked suspiciously back toward the farmhouse.
Never forget the order I gave you:you are to protect David Menlo and keep him alive at all costs.
The only thing they missedwas the wafer-thin computer on her wrist, which was shorted out anyway.
Seconds later, their podhad reversed out of the gallery and rejoined one of the disk-lined tubes.
The only thing that is meant, Agent Cooper, is for us to keep Max and David from the witches, she
The Master had given Lyra her own key to the garden door so she could come and go as she pleased.
Fredle spent the next days and nights thinking, wondering, foraging in the compost, and sleeping.
Suddenly, the buildingblocks of his beliefs and understandings toppled and smashed beyond repair.
For a while their laughterwiped away the troubles at hand, and they were reluctant to give it up.
By the time she crept into Reynie and Stickys room half an hour later, Kate was in a better mood.
When Judy and Stink finally fell asleep that night, visions of hourglasses danced in their heads.
A boy was bathing in a rI'ver and got out of his depth, and was in great danger of being drowned.
I have to admit I felt kind of the same way, and not just about yourletters, but about everyones.
A cord around his neck carried an impressive assemblage of keys of alldifferent sizes and shapes.
Twenty minutes later, Max sat in a luxurious compartment on a private train for public officials.
Youve got a better memory than me, said Carl as he looked around nervously at their surroundings.
That you didntknow whether it was real, or that you were going to give it to him without knowing.
Presumably the feet, shod inexpensive black shoes, belonged to the Ten Mans tranquilized partner.
Beyond it a little camp had been set up, with five or six tents and the remains of cooking fires.
A missing father and a mother teetering onthe brink of nervous collapse were numbers one and two.
Finally, he stopped at a gleaming gladius with a black-ridged hiltand a short, razor-edged blade.
I finally get Piper out of there, back down the stairs and into the bowling alley basement again.
Having thus driven the eagle almost out of her senses with terror, the cat climbed down the tree,
I think wed better come up with a plan of our own or were goingto be doing a lot of extra chores.
Finally, the prisoners fell quiet, the only sound being the creaking of the cages on their ropes.
And I know that Katestole aboard a boxcar in Chicago, while Sticky stowed away on a rI'ver barge.
I wasnt expecting company, said Rasmussen defensively, snatching the sock and tossing it toward a
sure; and anyway, even if you did prise a confession out of him, it would never hold up in court.
She felt a little quI'ver of laughter at the idea, but kept it out of hervoice as she explained: 
And if this temptation does takeplace, and if the child gives in, then Dust and sin will triumph.
If you mean you understand the prophecy, Theo, thats fantastic, because our lot didnthave a clue!
A moment later, the intention craft began to move, and the hawk wheeled away to skim down to Lord
The metal of the bridge was now heaving and rattling under the weight of the oncoming locomotive.
And I'vecaptured and held them, which was more, apparently, than your imbecile crew could manage.
She never missed it, and early the next morning would be out rolling freely in the dirt and bush.
Curtain rolled into the room twenty seconds later carrying a tall stack of newspapers in his lap.
If you dont mind, well take a late refreshment together after I've fulfilled my otherobligations.
The man I lived with used to like mountain climbing, and he taught me to climb, and I walk in the
I felt awfully sorry for her, so I had her hold onto my feet and lower me down through the grate.
He never would have gone to any of those places or met any of those people if he hadnt been flat.
And like I said,were sorry to have arrI'ved without any death, if thats the normal way of things.
Many of my former Executives hold government posts, you see,some of them quite close to Benedict.
You told me that Foaly had pulled surveillance on my communications, and anyway I wasnt sure youd
The message was almost finished, anyway, Kate said with a terrific yawn, and frankly, Im toasted.
Her voice was low and expressive, with a current of laughter and happiness under the clearsurface.
Maybe they have a special flavor like Shiver Me Timbers ice cream, and thats the sign of a pirate.
Given what shed been capable of at the age of two, there was no telling what she could do now that
It looked to be made of painted teak; hinges on the sideof the cube suggested a clamshell opening.
What I dont understand, Carl went on, is how a map that Ian drew could be pulled out of a box from
From the beach there was a collective gasp as the Kestrel lifted from the sea to hover in the air.
A moment later, David scampered up theplatform and onto the ship, his cheeks pink with excitement.
I think we should dig under the wind farm, said Zito, resting his forehead against the cool glass.
At that point, Iunderstand, the boy will be able to help them escape to another world, and safety.
I could tell shewas nervous, but a few people stood between her and the door, and she was trapped.
I guess every mouse has to went, sooner or later, Fredle said, sounding to his own ears a lot like
I never said steaming, said Holly, then decided that time was short and she could apologize later.
Beside him sat Juliet, then Foaly, then Mulch, and finally Holly, who had set the ship on neutral.
Kate was perhaps the only one who didnt half wish theyhadnt gotten away, but even she was subdued.
Finally, the professor sat back with an amazed expression and gently set the treasure on his desk.
They knowsomeone was in the culvert and swam away to escape  your soggy shoes are a dead giveaway.
She urged Reynie tostroke the birds feathers Reynie nervously obliged and then sent her off again.
I've spoken to the boy, and he seemed to be a stubborn child, and one well used tokeeping secrets.
When they finally come out, Jimmy is apologizing for not being able to play ball with Scout today.
Washington, who had been staring out the window, spoke up for the first time since theyd arrI'ved.
Two of them, while Prue looked on,drew small pistols from their coats and pointed them at the owl.
Few as we are, he went on, and short-lived as we are, and weak-sighted as we arein comparison with
If I went to the rI'ver, forexample, do you think I could find a passage on a steamer going south?
We could shoot them directly on to the surface in dire cases, but I think for security it would be
Seor Lorca opened his eyes and looked sharply at Max as if suddenly remembering that he was there.
Everyone looked at the envelope then, wondering where in the world  and into what unknown dangers 
The dragon looked to Buttons for help, and finally, Buttons had to literally push herfriends away.
Later, I learned that the Germans found the Jichmach with little trouble and asked about the Star.
She gave each of them a cloth bag, and they worked as they listened to the next part of the story.
But the wolf looked round justthen and said, Dont you imagine Im running away from you, my friend.
She was nervously eyeing the troop of Recruiters, whohad realized their leader was not among them.
Prue looked up the long line of crouched bandits and farmers, searching for some sort of guidance.
She, howe'ver, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping andpondering on the folly of her kind.
Max felt a stir of whispers through the dining hall; the older students looked grim and attentive.
The captain kept his face impassive, but the children got the distinct impression that he found Mr.
Later, much later, when things had turned outsometimes as hed planned, sometimes not as well as hed
Pressius stands to receive a fortune in insurance money for those stolen diamonds  much more money,
The wafers were the size of a thumbnail and were generally used to record short birthday greetings.
It is not you, Dame MalaYou've merely been sent to deliver amessage, and your task is now finished.
In adecisive motion, she freed her hands from her fathers and picked up the black box on the table.
Theyd swallow a lockpick or something, and later theyd use their throatmuscles to bring it back up.
And barely ten minutes later the soft sound of wingbeats came to their ears, and Balthamos stood up
One of those who came later was wiser than he was, and she found out the truth, so he banished her.
And the longer Constance stared,the darker her expression grew, until she was positively glowering.
While David was nowhere to be seen, Julie Teller had unfortunately chosen to sit at the next table.
With the addition of this bargaining chip, a moment of truth has arrI'ved when those who love Rowan
They looked, and so awesome was the sight that for a moment all thought of danger fled their minds.
Holly greeted No1 on the landing, but refused to hug him until he dropped the shape-shifting spell.
One was sentimental: her grandfather had given it to her, andshe had used it a lot as a schoolgirl.
Half-Truths and Deceptions I left as soon as I received Rhondas telegram, Moocho Brazos was saying.
I guess you can fill her in later, Reynie said doubtfully, and Sticky shook his head with a look of
There was no one else nearby, after all, and certainly the Gallivespians wouldnt be able to use it.
So this was why those other Messengers looked so happy, why theycraved their sessions so intensely!
shes probably had to get help, and when I go back, Ill be made to go into some kind of institution.
Recovering his breath, Reynie stepped out of range of Kates swats and said, You arent the only one.
The only thing Milligan feltcertain about was that she had escaped while her captors were sleeping.
They probably couldnt have me back at Jordan College,and I cant live with the bears or the witches.
Anyway, said Sarah, we came up here to see you all and to see if Max wants to go to classes with us.
Max glanced back for the furtive movements of a mouse or the faint flutter of a moth but sawnothing.
One ghost girl, who when she was alive must have been about nine or ten, reached up shyly to try and
The elevator rocketed straight down, accelerating to dizzying speeds until it stopped at Level five.
I've flown over your Outside city many times, but I cant say that I've had any interest in stopping.
And if welater on she was whispering shakily, if we meet someone that we like, and if we marry them,
Another bullet smashed into the side of the boat, and Ian ducked low, finallygetting the blade free.
It is the only gift I have, said Baruch, except the love of Balthamos, whom I shall never see again.
But I've never heard of a castle named Sticky or George or Washington or anything like it, have you?
Of course, it was not really some kind of super-vision, it was anunderstanding of his own abilities.
Benedicts Receiver was able to detect thepackage phrases, but not the information contained in them.
Benedictlooked up and said, For someone like me, Reynie, nighttime can be just as trying as daytime.
David walked over and returned the necklace that Cynthia had given them before they had stolen Brams
Stickyhad already located the first dictionary and was rapidly examining it as the others looked on.
Prue looked at the doors in front of her, bowled over by the fact that that had not occurred to her.
Max looked on as the soldier barring Jasons way was knocked unconscious by the strong blond boy, who
Before you were born, Lugh came to me in my sleep and told me I would give birth to a marvelous boy.
Anyway, even if we stole it and convinced people to read it, said Reynie, theyd think it was a hoax.
Bob looked out over the mourners and gestured for all to stand, and Nolan began to fiddle onceagain.
Hed never been near a Recruiter who wasntsmiling, and certainly not one who looked inconsolably sad.
You can expect to return home today, safe in the knowledge that your family will be unitedonce more.
Vilyak patted Max on the shoulder and steered him toward a massive vault whose shining door of black
Ever since his arrival at Rowan, Maxs roommate had exhibited afreakishly intuitive grasp of Mystics.
Better to die free than live a slave, concluded Bob, the ogres basso voice rumbling from beneath his
There is absolutely nopossible way a woman such as herself could survI've in the wild for that long.
There was a change of plans, Reynie said, but we can explain all that later, when youre not so busy.
Curtain and his closestassistants his Executives, as they were called unfortunately avoided capture.
The two boys hurriedalong the packed sand, up the steps, and down the dock like a pair of fugitives.
My brother, for example, but also his Executives, his henchmen, theother students at the Institute  
I think Im speaking for the whole room here,Foaly, when I say that all I see is lines and squiggles.
They were in the dark for quite a while, but finally Ian could see the shapes of their surroundings.
When FatherGomez leaves, with our blessing, he will be on his own, unable to be reached or recalled.
I think its about time the Council declared me king for life, he said, fixing the crown on his head.
As usual, they all broke into gales of laughter, Biff finally lying on the ground rolling toand fro.
He stood up and looked over at the long, spindly ladder that was leaning up against the cavern wall.
They laughed, and moved back into the workshops, where a later, more advanced model of the intention
Its a common nightmare, andive had it many times, as well as a great many others that are more rare.

The cabin looked as if someone had emptied a kitchen into it drawers, cupboards, trash cans, and all.

And finally, Delph could heave a sigh of relief as he loweredhis paw, the trap clinking as he did so.
If their knowing that he had a name, knowing what that name was, would give him a chance to survI've,
Tatters of fog came sweeping over the cliffs to run like swift rI'vers alongthe walkways and gardens.
Her opinion altered sharply when one of the amorphobots changed color from translucent green to angry
When they finally made their way to the streets, Ian stared openmouthed at all the view had to offer.
McDaniels blinked twice and took a long, quI'vering breath while he fumbled through his aprons pocket
Wincing with pain, she looked up to see Reynie turning from the window, stillclutching the briefcase.
Reynie looked south over the meadow; Kate looked north to the openstretch of ground beyond the woods.
Friend, friend, friend, Nat says, but I see her arms slowly unfurl from her chest, then her hands and
Puffs of smoke were erupting from beyondthe roofs, followed a few seconds later by the boom of a gun.
I'vegiven them more in the last fifteen years than theyve ever enjoyed in the history of their breed.
His roommate looked likea small lump of uncooked dough that had been wedged into a corner of the pod.
No one seems to realize how much we are driven by FEAR, the essential component of human personality.
They arrI'ved at the far end of the room, and Roger nodded to the attach, who had been waiting at the

That blade was the emperors own, till it was given toFlamma to honor him after a string of victories.
Finally, seeing her opportunity, the cat broke free and with one leap made it to the top of thefence.
The extremists from both sides were driven off to pursue their passionsin other corners of the world.
I used to suffer from the occasional fit of pique, as you well know, but they generally did not last.
You should know that PeterVarga is not the only son of Rowan to cross the mountains and seek our aid.
When he had finally vented his anger, the centaurs brain kicked in, and he hauled himself up from the

An hour or twosexperimenting with some fine tough cord and a length of springy branch produced a bow; the Swiss Armyknife cut some arrows, with stiff leaves in place of feathers to stabilize them in flight; and finally, after adays work, Mary was ready to begin.
The only world he could find with the same conformation of ground was a bare, rocky place, where themoon glared down from a starry sky onto a bleached bone-white ground where little insects crawled anduttered their scraping, chittering sounds over a wide silence.
But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers saw what he was about to do, they begged him to spare it,and said to him, If you destroy the tree we shall have to seek shelter elsewhere, and you will no longerhave our merry chirping to enliven your work in the garden.
When they had arrI'ved at the top, the carriage came to a stop in front of the grandesthouse on the blockit was a three-story behemoth of alabaster-white stone, and twin cherubs carryingtrumpets met in a relief carved into the ground floor windows ornate molding.

The only light came from the pale reflection in the snowbank of the remainsof the fire, and that, in turn, was reflected from her wet cheeks, and her tears found their own reflection inWills eyes, and so those photons wove the two children together in a silent web.
As he stood by the waters edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared andasked him the reason for his grief; and on learning what had happened, out of pity for his distress he divedinto the rI'ver and, bringing up a golden ax, asked him if that was the one he had lost.
He knew that it would take a minute to translate that and let the message spread out among the watchingtownsfolk, and he knew, too, that the delay would prevent their relief and anger from bursting out, as a netof sandbanks baffles and breaks up the flow of a rI'ver.
Once they had begun to talk mostly in the wheeled peoples language, although she managed to teachthem a few words of English: they could say anku and grass and tree and sky and rI'ver, andpronounce her name, with a little difficulty they progressed much more quickly.
But as it backed out of the petals and took to theair again, she saw that it was no insect, for a moment later it made for her hand and perched on her finger,dipping a long needle-like beak against her skin with the utmost delicacy and then taking flight again when it
Carl began to giggle and soon he was laughing and rocking back and forth, pointing first at the professor,then at Ian, who couldnt help laughing too, and it all seemed very funny until the professor cleared histhroat gruffly and snapped, What is so amusing, young men?
The two children, sheltering the Gallivespians, crouched down with their arms over their heads; and then ina horrible sliding movement they found themselves being borne away down to the left, and they held eachother fiercely, too breathless and shaken even to cry out.
It was as if hed said, No, dont kill me, Im frightened; kill my mother instead;she doesnt matter, I dont love her, and as if shed heard him say it, and pretended she hadnt so as tospare his feelings, and offered herself in his place anyway because of her love for him.
In fact, if she were to list her worries right then and there as she satspellbound on the park bench and watched her little brother, Mac, carried aloft in the talons of these fiveblack crows, puzzling out just how this feat was being done would likely come in dead last.
Youll do no such thing, said an unfamiliar voice, followed by three successive swit, swit, swits, upon whichMartinas eyes crossed, Jackson and Jillson sighed, and all three collapsed upon the ground unconscious,dart feathers blooming from their shoulders as if by magic.
The skipper brought the vessel to a halt in a valley bottom that normally would have been carpetedwith grass and mountain flowers, where the rI'ver would have meandered over gravel beds; but the valleywas now a lake, and the captain insisted that he dared not go past it.
In one of his letters he hadexplained, Here you will be met with a surprise that I hope will please all of you  a surprise that, while itinadequately expresses my gratitude, not to mention my great and lasting affection for you, neverthelessstrikes me as an appropriate .

Lord Asriel looked at him directly, and the little man knew at once that hed taken advantage of hiscommanders courtesy: the force of Lord Asriels glance flicked him like a finger, so that he lost his balanceand had to put out a hand to steady himself on Lord Asriels wineglass.
This was the only home and family that so many of the orphans atDelphi Keep had ever known, and while a good portion of the children dreamt daily about being adopted bypeople they could finally call Mummy and Daddy, some, like Ian and Phillip, were quite happy where they were.
The death stood very close, smiling kindly, his face exactly like those of all the others shed seen; but thiswas hers, her very own death, and Pantalaimon at her breast howled and shivered, and his ermine shapeflowed up around her neck and tried to push her away from the death.
The mulefa received them with delight, and in return offered objects of their own workmanship: rare vesselsof ancient knot wood, lengths of the finest rope and cord, lacquered bowls, and fishing nets so strong andlight that even the Fen-dwelling gyptians had never seen the like.
The mist sat heavily on the rI'ver basin and created a floor of clouds that hid the water below, giving theillusion that the bridge sat at a tremendous height, like one of those delicate rope bridges spanning somecloudy Peruvian chasm Prue had seen in National Geographic magazine.
But it fell andfell, all the great length of it smashed its way out of the grove and seemed to lean toward Mary beforecrashing into the ground like a wave against a breakwater; and the colossal trunk rebounded up a little way,and settled down finally, with a groaning of torn wood.
While the downtown continued to sprout toweringcondominium buildings, and newly minted terra-cotta outlet malls bloomed beside the highway in thesuburbs, it baffled Prue that such an impressive swath of land should go unclaimed, untouched,undeveloped, right on the edge of the city.
Constance had finally given up and dozed off, while in the bunk above her, Sticky sat with his feet danglingover the edge, absently rubbing his scalp which had begun to feel sandpapery with new stubble andexpounding  rather too loudly and at great length  upon modern ocean vessels.
Little hamlets, theirfew quaint huts spewing peat smoke, nestled into far-flung hillsides; a single wide, meandering roadPrueguessed it to be the North Wood tributary of the Long Roadcarved its way through the landscape like awild rI'ver, disappearing finally among the wooded hills.
His present circumstances, he reasoned, would seem pretty strangeand frightening if he were to look at them in the cool light of day, but there, in the warm confines of theearthy burrow with the braziers burning and the moss below him so comfortable, everything lookedparticularly rosy.
The whole businessthe plane flight, the hotel, the bright sunlight, the foreign languages all around me, the well-known peoplewho were going to speak, and the thought of my own paper and wondering whether anyone would turn upto listen and whether Id be too nervous to get the words out .
The acolytes brow was wrinkled with concentration as the grass continued to weave togetherbut theuniformity of the braids slowly grew more chaotic and messy until the woven patterns becameindistinguishable and the tuft of grass had knotted itself into a tangle of quI'vering green wires.
When theyd finally arrI'ved at the doors of the Mansion, the major players of the Svikadministration had either escaped, running into the surrounding woods to, presumably, find refuge in somedamp gully in Wildwood, or were kneeling in supplication on the marble floor of the Mansion foyer.
A fewSpecters still remained in the upper airs, and some witches flew into them unseeing, to cry out and tumbleblazing to the ground; but most of the pallid things had reached the earth by this time, and the great flightof witches streamed like a rI'ver of fire into the heart of the storm.
Sure enough, as the long column of farmers and bandits made their way through a peaceful stand of tallalders, their leaves a kaleidoscope of yellow and green hues, they arrI'ved at an impressive snarl ofblackberry bushes that stretched like a wall in either direction, seemingly impregnable.
He lingered there for a long time before at last returning to his place, and when he was woken up the nextmorning by the same thundering sounds of the dogs jumping down onto the stalks to drink their water andleave drops scattered all around for him, he saw another orange peel beside his bed.
Will and the bear-king were on the foredeck of the rI'ver steamer, in the warm rays of the setting sun, andthe vessel was making swift progress upstream; there was plenty of fuel on board, there was food that Willcould eat, and he and Iorek Byrnison were taking their second measure of each other.
He found a new world and slid the knife along to make an opening, and a fewmoments later all of them were standing in what looked like a neat and prosperous farmyard in somenorthern country like Holland or Denmark, where the stone-flagged yard was swept and clean and a row ofstable doors stood open.
It is his wishthat you have all the advantages of regular children with families who attend private schools, and thereforehe sought out my brother and me, who are well versed in all the general education classes that will give youthe best possible chance to enter society as adults properly educated.
I couldpicture a girl swimming in that pond  so young it was hard to believe she could swim at all, much lesssplash and dive about like an otter  and in my minds eye I drew her near to me, heard her laughing, and,as I took her hand to lead her home, heard her ask me, Daddy, may we come to the mill again?
An immense series of smaller nests occupied some of the lower branches, each inhabited bydroves of sparrows and finches; above them, a smaller number of larger nests, these sheltering flocks ofhawks and falconsall leading up to a single, massive roost crowning the topmost branch, the pinnacle ofthe tree.
Instead of seeing only the wickedness and cruelty andgreed of the ghosts that come down here, from now on you will have the right to ask all the ghosts to tellyou the stories of their lives, and they will have to tell the truth about what theyve seen and touched and heard and loved and known in the world.
In Marys world they had a kind of picture that looked at first like random dots of color but that, when youlooked at it in a certain way, seemed to advance into three dimensions: and there in front of the paperwould be a tree, or a face, or something else surprisingly solid that simply wasnt there before.
Men were running here and there like ants; some lay dead, whileothers crawled brokenly over the rocks; the great cable from the generating station snaked down throughthe chaos, the only purposeful thing in sight, making its way to the glittering bomb, where the Presidentsbody lay crumpled inside the cage.
They told of agreat and impending danger, he said ominously Donovan and I used to share a bit of whiskey every nightaround dusk and discuss our separate excavations and I do remember at the time being startled to learnthat Laodamia had such impressive examples of forecasting events far out into the future.
Hammers the size of houses were lifted in a moment to the distant ceiling and then hurleddownward to flatten balks of iron the size of tree trunks, pounding them flat in a fraction of a second with ablow that made the very mountain tremble; from a vent in the rocky wall, a rI'ver of sulphurous molten metal
Theres a time, usually the same time as the carrots and onions and potatoes are running outthe applesalways run out firstalthough we never have to worry, because food hasnt ever run entirely out  Anyway,during that time, Missus sometimes moves that thing, that window, and the air that comes in is warmer, and
The old one was uttering a wordless groaning whimper thatwent on and on, and grinding his teeth, and compulsively plucking at himself with his free hand; but as Lyrareached in, too, to help him out, he tried to smile, and to bow, and his ancient eyes deep in their wrinklesblinked at her with innocent wonder.
Finally, the pair reached the safety of the outer walls of thekeep and with the last remnants of their energy they stumbled through the large metal gates and up theshort drive, staying to the right of the main building until they reached the front lawn, where they tumbledto the ground to lie panting and spent.
There was a sort of halfsecond of shocked silence that seemed to Curtis to last an eternity before the quiet was broken by acollective, impassioned cry from the entire hillside and the bandit line burst into action, tearing down theravine, their swords, clubs, and knI'ves brandished savagely above their heads.
I will take the first, said he, because I amking of the beasts; I will also take the second, because as your partner, I am entitled to half of whatremains; and as for the thirdwell, unless you give it up to me and take yourself off pretty quick, the third,believe me, will make you feel very sorry for yourself!
She burned the designa simple daisyinto the wood, and delighted Atal; but as thethin line of smoke wafted up from the spot where the focused sunlight touched the wood, Mary thought: Ifthis became fossilized, and a scientist in ten million years found it, they could still find Shadows around it,because I've worked on it.
And she described the smells around the place, the smoke from the kilns, the rotten-leaf-mold smell of therI'ver when the wind was in the southwest, the warm smell of the baking potatoes the clayburners used toeat; and the sound of the water slipping slickly over the sluices and into the washing pits; and the slow, thick
Far largerthan a cathedral, the Archives stretched out before him in a gleaming array of tables and cases and booksthousands and thousands of books arranged around sweeping balconies that rose up and up in a gentlespiral until Maxs gaze fell upon a lighted fresco depicting the School of Athens hundreds of feet above them.

The Gallivespians had flown ahead, and he could see their bright little forms darting andskimming over the heads of the ghosts, who looked up and followed them with wonder; but the silence wasimmense and oppressive, and the gray light filled him with fear, and Lyras warm presence beside him wasthe only thing that felt like life.
And I must say thatalthough I do find it a particularly odd coincidence that someone fluent in ancient Greek would write Iansname upon the wall of a forgotten cavern, it still seems unlikely to me that this person would also know thatthe beast would be lurking within a nearby tunnel when Ian finally came along to remove the box.
She quickly determined the best route: First a short northwesterly descent to a prominent goat path that led almost allthe way down the mountain; then slantwise across a long gravel slope giving as wide a berth as possible tosome treacherous bluffs; and finally across the black rock plain to the bay forest, which from here appeared
They seemed packed closer together, theirgrowth unhindered in this wild country; indeed, trees were not the only vegetation that sought theconcentrated light at this heightfantastic vines of ivy had clambered to the top of several unfortunatemaple trees, seemingly suffocating their hosts in the attempt to reach the blue of the sky.
Whenever they could, theylooked ahead of them fixedly, on this rock, that foothold, this projection, that loose slope of gravel, and kepttheir eyes from the gulf; but it pulled, it tempted, and they couldnt help glancing into it, only to feel theirbalance tilting and their eyesight swimming and a dreadful nausea gripping their throats.
When the owl gave no answer, the man at the bookcase cleared his throat and said in a loud, authoritativetone, Owl Rex, Crown Prince of the Avian Principality, we are putting you under arrest for the violation ofthe Wildwood Protocols, Section Three, the harboring of an illegal, and for conspiring to overthrow thegovernment of South Wood.
Pan, no ones done this before, she whispered shiveringly, but Will says were coming back and I swear,Pan, I love you, I swear were coming backI willtake care, my dearyoull be safewe will come back,and if I have to spend every minute of my life finding you again, I will, I wont stop, I wont rest, I wontoh, Pandear PanI've got to, I've got to .
From time to time the living ones looked back and saw the infinite line of the dead winding out of the cracktheyd come through: mothers pressing their infants faces to their breasts, aged fathers clambering slowly,little children clutching the skirts of the person in front, young boys and girls of Rogers age keeping staunchand careful, so many of them .
The crows hadcleared the precipice and were funneling skyward like a shivering black twister cloud, framed by the risingsmoke from the many smelters and smokestacks of the Industrial Wastes, a veritable no-mans-land on theother side of the rI'ver, long ago claimed by the local industrial barons and transformed into a forbiddinglandscape of smoke and steel.
Being the postmaster general, its my job to delivermail and supplies and whatnot from the folks in South Wood to the country folk in North Wood and viceversa, and I do that by driving this blasted roadits called the Long Road, which is a no-brainer of a nameback and forth between the two places, braving this madness and putting my life and limb at great riskevery week.
Metatrons orders had been to takethe Authority to a place of safety away from the battlefield, because he wanted him kept alive for a whileyet; but rather than give him a bodyguard of many regiments, which would only attract the enemysattention, he had trusted to the obscurity of the storm, calculating that in these circumstances, a small partywould be safer than a large one.
At least Reynie found it amusing to think so, for he had just determined that hispresent situation could be described entirely in terms of halves: he was half a days drI've from the suburbsof Stonetown, where he lived; half a mile from the nearest small town; and according to the man who hadgiven him directions, he had another half mile to go before he reached his destination.
And yet, in certain ways, theInstitute did remind them of other schools: Rote memorization of lessons was discouraged but required;class participation was encouraged but rarely permitted; and although quizzes were given every day, inevery class, there was always at least one student who groaned, another who acted surprised, and anotherwho begged the teacher, in vain, not to give it.
It was the first time since theyd arrI'ved that no one was talking orin Milligans case working, and as they stood there they slowly became aware of the islands sounds: windflapping the edges of Milligans tarpaulin and shushing in the boughs of the trees, tree trunks groaning andcreaking as they swayed, birds chittering and fluttering as they settled into their roosts for the night, the bay
Each of them was lavish in his praises of the heroes of his own city, untileventually the Theban asserted that Hercules was the greatest hero who had ever lived on earth, and nowoccupied a foremost place among the gods; while the Athenian insisted that Theseus was far superior, forhis fortune had been in every way supremely blessed, whereas Hercules had at one time been forced to actas a servant.
She told them about the willow treesalong the rI'vers edge, with their leaves all silvery underneath; and she told how when the sun shone formore than a couple of days, the clay began to split up into great handsome plates, with deep cracksbetween, and how it felt to squish your fingers into the cracks and slowly lever up a dried plate of mud,trying to keep it as big as you could without breaking it.
For if Artemis Fowl mislaid his modified phone, it would be a little more seriousthan if Johnny Highschool happened to lose the latest touch-screen model, unless Johnny Highschoolsphone happened to have enough tech inside it to easily hack any government site, a nice little laser pointerthat could be focused to burn through metal, and the first draft of Artemis Fowls memoirs, which did a littlemore than kiss and tell.
There they met Roger, and when Jordan was attacked by the brickburners who lived in the claybeds, they had to escape in a hurry; so she and Will and Roger captured a gyptian narrow boat and sailed itall the way down the Thames, nearly getting caught at Abingdon Lock, and then theyd been sunk by theWapping pirates and had to swim for safety to a three-masted clipper just setting off for Hang Chow inCathay to trade for tea.
He took asmall magnifying glass in a steel case, because he could use it to light fires and save his matches; a reel oftough twine; an alloy canteen for water, much lighter than the goatskin flask he had been carrying, and asmall tin cup; a small pair of binoculars; a roll of gold coins the size of a mans thumb, wrapped in paper; afirst-aid kit; water-purifying tablets; a packet of coffee; three packs of compressed dried fruit; a bag ofoatmeal biscuits; six bars of Kendal Mint Cake; a packet of fishhooks and nylon line; and finally, a notebookand a couple of pencils, and a small electric torch.
Then she told how the clayburners children always made war on the townies, but how they were slow anddull, with clay in their brains, and how the townies were as sharp and quick as sparrows by contrast; andhow one day all the townies had swallowed their differences and plotted and planned and attacked theclaybeds from three sides, pinning the clayburners children back against the rI'ver, hurling handfuls andhandfuls of heavy, claggy clay at one another, rushing their muddy castle and tearing it down, turning thefortifications into missiles until the air and the ground and the water were all mixed inextricably together,and every child looked exactly the same, mud from scalp to sole, and none of them had had a better day in all their lives.
