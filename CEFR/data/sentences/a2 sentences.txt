That’s Speedy! 
Carter laughing.
Yes, that’s why.
A talking bird! 
Oh, that’s easy.
I have to know! 
Why do you ask? 
Carter, laughing.
It’s only a game.
I have to go now.
I am a miningman.
There was nothing
I was going down.
Cherry dumplings.
But it’s moving! 
That’s all right.
Someone’s coming.
Alden, laughing .
That’s right now.
Let’s buy things.
Fenton, laughing.
Stop this minute.
Rivers, smiling .
We must catch y! 
Let’s live here! 
How do you know? 
I’ll bring it up.
He is ringing it.
No, it’s too far.
I hear something.
Hill, looking up.
He was thinking .
Let’s have beans.
What do you know! 
The talking horse.
He must have some.
What do you think?
It is boiling hot.
What is he doing? 
Maybe for nothing.
Where do you live?
He’s the engineer.
Now ring the bell.
Yes, it’s too bad.
He pushed his thin
It’s getting late.
So please show us.
He’s going crazy! 
He’s gone, anyway.
I don’t have to go
If he sinks, fine.
What do you mean? 
I’m going to stop.
You must be tired.
I’m going to fix a
Come on, let’s go.
What’s your name? 
Carter, frowning .
How much would you
Let’s get to work.
Cook, getting out.
Do you mind, Joe? 
we must have salt.
Yes, that’s right.
It’s Delbert King.
here’s the island.
Carter, laughing .
Not if its closed.
Alden, getting up.
Somebody’s coming.
Can you disarm it?
I should say if we
Where’s Snowball? 
What shall we do? 
it’s coming soon? 
We need a shingle.
That’s all I care.
What do you smell?
It’s never locked.
I’m pushing, too! 
He’s a good farmer.
When is the wedding
Then get some more.
I have to find him.
And if youre wrong?
That’s poison ivy! 
Eating with spoons.
Let’s do something.
If it worked once .
You’ll have to take
Where do you think?
He’s very friendly.
Do you own the van?
I have to tell her.
I have what I need.
How would you know?
Can you enhance it?
Can you believe it?
Let’s ask this one.
Can you get it out?
How do you know my 
Do you know Larry? 
Let’s go, said Sam.
How do you do, Mrs.
If I have a future.
What do you do now?
That’s the mystery.
Come on, let’s go! 
That’s what I said.
Do you understand? 
He’s just for cubs.
We’re celebrating! 
But he was joking .
If it got that far.
You play some more.
It’s a flying fish.
I have to see Mike.
If I'd  been a boy 
Just go on packing.
I bet it’s nothing.
That’s what I mean.
He’s just grown up.
Missing! called Al.
Now, what’s first? 
I have no Idea how.
Please, said Benny.
Sardines have to be
That’s why we came.
Please let us go to
Ill be darned if he
Do you have a plan?
What is he saying? 
And I have muscles.
He has to climb it.
He can do anything.
What shall we say? 
Let’s go, he said .
It must be very big.
See her fingers fly.
more are on the way.
It must have a name.
It must be very old.
I have it, from my .
A thief if you like.
Try something else! 
Do you want it off? 
Let’s go in and see.
He is going to win! 
Here’s a big kettle.
As if you dont know.
I have to reach him.
Fishing! said Henry.
Got any more jokes? 
Here’s a long stick.
Please do, said Joe.
Let’s go for a ride.
Good morning, Benny.
stand it if its not.
He stopped paddling.
Would you teach me? 
I’m going to get Dr.
Do you? asked Larry.
Browning, said Joe .
If it should crack, 
He’ll be so pleased.
That’s what it says.
Let’s save the meat.
Where do you sleep? 
Do you like apples? 
He likes everything—
If she could survive
She must be old now.
We had riding horses
If it dies, it dies.
Why are you crying? 
He’s always with me.
Do you ever miss it?
If I could remember.
I was only guessing.
Nothing, said Henry.
Do you smell a trap?
That’s Bill’s house.
Do you need a piton?
Hello, what’s this? 
That’s pretty smart.
That’s right, Benny.
Please everybody sit
Alden is leaving his
Now let me do yours.
The telephone’s out.
I was just thinking.
Do you speak French?
What do you suggest?
I have things to do.
What do you mean WE?
can you do anything?
And if she dI'd not?
Can you see a timer?
There’s a little hut.
Alden, smiling again.
I may have the touch.
Can you do it, Holly?
It’s awful, said Hal.
Can you believe that?
Oh, he’s a hound dog.
Do you see this mark?
So everyone is coming
Can you blow that up?
Just almost starving.
Would you like a gun?
He’s always been odd.
They are both waving.
It’s the Coast Guard.
We’ll do the talking.
You will have to step
Let’s dig! cried Joe.
I saw something else.
What I have to say is
What do I have to do?
It’s cool enough now.
Would you like them? 
What else can you do?
What time do you call
Can you disable them?
Why would you dothat?
That’s exactly right.
If you let us go now.
Do you think Coach G.
It must seem strange.
Ill eh see if hes in.
There’s a sign on it.
Now, what do you see?
He’s getting over it.
He’s my twin brother.
Can you stomach that?
But if youre not back
Can you sign my shoe?
Can you do it or not?
He’s getting out now.
Let’s go, said Benny.
We will have to hav e
Let’s race the dogs! 
Let’s go! said Henry.
If I may, Miss Koboi.
What can you give me?
Do you not understand
I dont know if I can.
Guest of Miss Gray’s.
How do you know about
Hello, Max! It’s me! 
Do you know Shadrack?
I’ll have to tie him.
Long’s store by road.
I think he’s making a
Glowing? asked Henry.
How do you like coal?
How do you like that?
I have had enough of 
Are we going to bed? 
Let’s go back and get
That’s what the paper
Maggie’s brother, Sam
Here’s our fireplace.
Here’s another thing.
I have to be on-site.
That’s a better idea.
How do you know that?
For if she could fly,
I have a theory, sir.
That’s what makes the
Let’s go, said Henry.
Do anything you want.
It’s a pile of claws.
Queer thing happened.
Only if it has to be.
It’s just a woodshed.
Very attractive, if I
It’s your cousin Joe.
Let’s try, said Mike.
So if youre expecting
If you do, you might.
He’d have to take it.
I have four, you see.
How can you say that?
Boy, do you see that?
Isn’t this exciting! 
Do you have the money?
What do you suppose is
It’s good! said Benny.
He dug out some more .
If you see what Imean.
You are getting heavy.
Are you staying long? 
Mom, do you know them?
Ask anything you like.
I am not going to cry.
I have a stomach ache!
Let’s have vegetables.
I tell him everything.
Arty, can you hear me?
Would you like to rest
Must have been my son.
Lars is going with us.
It’s a clue all right.
Mulch, can you tunnel?
Now, if you could just
Do you mind if I stay?
and so I have neither.
That’s right, said Al.
Now I must get supper.
it’s too high, anyway.
Apparently he has seen
Do you see that manor?
Do you still have him?
I’ll have to take two.
I call it Jim’s Place.
What do you mean home?
Just for Lovan’s sake.
It’s an awful old gun.
if you can believe it.
They must be two deep.
Irish, if you have it.
Good morning, said Dr.
I have time for jokes?
I must pass Number 16.
Do you need help down?
Showing off, they are.
If he asks you to look
Now what’s next, Joe? 
Now do you believe us?
Do you see how I live?
It’s like a waterfall.
I wasn’t even looking.
What do you mean safe?
He went off whistling.
Can you understand me?
Alden leaning forward.
Something might happen
I’m going right down! 
I never said anything.
The sun is going down.
Theyre all I have now.
I’m keeping the store.
You’ll be walking over
And even if I dId, why
Do you? asked Jessie .
He’s eleven years old.
How many do you count?
Shall we take it out? 
No cold—just stuffing.
How many can you take?
Stop what? she asked .
Do you have transport?
Something may come up.
Whatever I have to do.
Let’s dig, said Benny.
While we are eating we
Well, what do you see?
Unless I have an Idea.
It’s a lady from town.
This is Violet’s room.
But I am going to drop
He’s a big help to me.
Probably Mike’s has M.
He’s a very handy man.
That’s what I thought.
It isn’t going to end.
Where would you sleep?
Well, what if I wasnt?
We did more than that.
How I have missed you.
I do like most things.
Let’s get out of here.
Let’s put screen cloth
Do you like my weapon?
If you hurt her, Kong 
I have a neat Beretta.
I must eat my supper! 
Because I have anIdea.
It’s the same sandbox.
Please come! he cried.
That’s OK, said Benny.
It must be suppertime.
Let’s find that motel.
You must tell us that.
Do you want some help?
Let’s look for spoons,
Thanks for telling me.
He has sensitive feet.
It was exciting, too! 
What do you say, Papa?
Holly, do you trust me?
Holly, can you hear me?
Could do your boys too.
That’s right, said Jim.
It’s just right for us.
Can you really do that?
Can you see him, Holly?
Nothing, replied Benny.
That’s right, Mr. Smith
Please? chimed Arthur .
I know a lot of things.
Do you really think so?
No? said Lars laughing.
What shall I do, then? 
Do you know what to do?
I would need more time.
How can you be so sure?
A swing! shouted Benny.
Do you not remember me?
Can you slow them down?
Do you have to be tall?
That’s wonderful, Mike.
would you look at that?
If you see what I mean.
Yes, let’s, said Benny.
His eyes were shining .
Let’s hunt, said Benny.
Nothing, said Mr. Smith
How can you be so smug?
My clothes are going to
There’s plenty of room.
Sister wasn’t tattling.
I should have told you.
Do you know him, Mulch?
I heard more than that.
He has help, of course.
Let's stop for a treat.
What do you have there?
Would you look at that?
What do you make of it?
Maybe there’s a cellar.
I don’t smell anything.
But I have to eat, too.
I’m sending a note home
The only thing is Jane.
I have magic, mud-worm.
That’s his name anyway.
Oh, he gives us things.
This is more important.
That’s OK, said Benny .
He’s a queer character.
What do you want, Chix?
That’s fine, said Mama.
I dont think I have to.
Do you think you can do
You may call me Jifaar.
He’s just a big talker.
But how would you know?
Why do you snoop on me?
Do you want to go look?
It must be interesting.
What do you want to do?
Scant, do you have any?
I have a test tomorrow.
Another thing, he said.
Ma wants some more tea.
What do you say, Stink?
Shall I run you a bath?
I have the only set, so
What do you think, Ian?
He’s lost, said Benny .
He will stop some time.
Lidstone said, smiling.
She going to eat this? 
HONK IF YOU LOVE PLUTO.
Where do you want this?
Downright embarrassing.
That’s it, cried Henry.
It’s funny, said Benny.
I’m glad we’re spending
That’s what we will do.
said Henry, getting up.
Let’s see, said Jessie.
More rocks, said Henry.
You don’t have to come.
If I win, Im a prodigy.
If you please, my lord!
They say he has powers.
She’s fine, said Benny.
It’s a circus caboose! 
She was still shaking .
Joe dug up things for a
Do you think he saw us?
Do you see all of this?
Can you do that, Holly?
We were doing all right
He has all the numbers.
Just in a perfect ring.
It’s Violet, Aunt Jane.
She’s very strong, too.
Now another thing, Ben.
Joking? cried Mr. Smith
He’s lucky, said Henry.
That’s right, said Joe.
It must have been late.
Mike’s gone, said Myna.
What should we do now? 
Let’s call this Mystery
Mike’s Mother’s Place! 
Now that’s a good idea.
Sure, said Joe, smiling.
What’s that? asked Mike.
He’s just sitting there.
He was shivering, but he
What do youwant from us?
We could go swimming any
This way, if you please.
It’s funny, said Jessie.
Later, the mayorcame by.
Do you have the package?
It’s a very small place.
What if hes flat for the
Would you like a square?
Long, shaking his head .
Let’s ask him something.
That’s right, said Mike.
What’s the matter, Ben? 
What do you mean drivel?
He was not yelling now .
I was coming right back.
We both love camping and
Henry can make anything.
That’s right, said Papa.
Wood said about baking? 
I may keep you, Artemis.
He’s our oldest brother.
Moore, smiling at Benny.
It’s good, sir, he said.
He likes things we make.
Let’s make it go, Henry.
Let’s call him Snowball.
That’s the last lake for
He may be there already.
Something new every day.
We can catch more later.
That’s so, Jessie said .
That’s right, said Lars.
They’ll get soaking wet.
Let’s each put on one of
It’s Joe! shouted Benny.
Maybe a hundred or more.
Do you like them or not?
This is the last string.
So, if you wouldnt mind.
He held up Alice’s hand.
He’s really a fisherman.
He wants caviar, can you
Speaking of Mexico, Mrs.
There must be some vases
Oh please! they shouted.
That’s good, said Benny.
It looks more like iron.
But that’s just a guess.
I could do you a favour.
But maybe that’s just as
That’s fine, said Henry.
Oh, let’s! cried Violet.
Bring the back door key.
Oh, please, said Violet.
I have to get closer, he
Browning, said Mr. Smith
But I must toddle along.
That’s how we kept warm.
Can you hear me, Nicole?
Can you juggle at least?
Can you bring them back?
That’s true, said Mama .
That’s right, said Jeff.
How exciting this is! We
Can youreach the screen?
How old do I have to be?
It seems he has the rest
That’s all, said Freddy.
She’s into healthsnacks.
I have to reconstruct an
I asked you, what do you
Can I have Spotty, too? 
Just don’t say anything.
Please do! cried Violet.
We must go, said Jessie.
Alden looking at Benny .
Alden, winking at Benny.
I have lost many things.
now let’s all go to bed.
I have matured, Captain.
Im wondering if I might 
I have one, saI'd Stink.
It’s part of a skeleton.
If I go, we go together.
If you wear a name tag .
The man’s name was Bill.
The men are going to let
I have not travelled all
As if I would kill these
Then it’s worth nothing.
Shall I read it for you?
If you agree to help me.
I have a lot of buckets.
I have a grander vision.
As if shed just realized
I have come home to you.
And, what do you intend?
Osgood knew everything .
Organic, if you have it.
That’s nice, said Alice.
It’s old, said the man .
We must catch that bus! 
Do you breathe fire too?
How do you like the plan
So if he lives, he wins.
Oh, do you? asked Henry.
If I go down, so do you.
So we are having two more
do you think will happen?
Weston, shaking his head.
She’s gone, Stanley said.
Who do you think you are?
I have something for you.
He’s alive, the man said.
Very well, do your worst.
Do you know how it opens?
He’s all right, said Mrs.
Now, if you wouldnt mind.
You know a lot of things.
What would you have saId?
If it hadnt been for the 
Yes, said Henry, smiling.
I played I was eating it.
That’s great, said Henry.
That’s right, said Alice.
Your grandfather’s name? 
Now let’s get on our way.
He pushed up his glasses.
He can’t help being mean.
That was a fine landing! 
If you ask me, were using
She has hold of Mr. Smith
That’s an exciting place.
She’s swell! said Benny .
Moose, mind if I come in?
If Imwrong, we could die.
Let’s go exploring again.
Do you want to see them? 
I have had enough of you!
It’s all right, said Mrs.
If indeed she was female.
It’s lovely, said Violet.
Do you understand, Short?
What do you make of that?
But everyone kept looking
It’s lovely, said Jessie.
How can you be so stupId?
How do you know all this?
Why do you like her then?
No! It isn’t morning yet.
What do you think, Chips?
Do I have to participate?
That’s funny! said Henry.
There’s Sam! said Benny .
What do you mean, Henry? 
That’s good, said Jessie.
Of course, if you insist 
If he hadhad a secretary.
Let’s go into the bakery.
I want to see everything.
Do you think theyre real?
We’ll ring the bell whe n
I have him, Opal cackled.
He’s good company for me.
Why do you want to know? 
I’m thinking, said Benny.
It’s as big as a washtub.
And how do you know that?
What do you think, Moose?
what I have been through.
There’s one with antlers.
Just one minute, please! 
Yes, said Maggie smiling.
Let’s get in, said Benny.
I have plenty of spIders.
I have one of Hollys now.
Let’s get out and see it.
I have a message for you,
I mean everything I say! 
Ah, Carlos said, nodding.
Everything is ready then.
Earl Grey if you have it.
How’s this? asked Henry .
He has no sense of smell.
Do you hear that, Eloise?
Qwan, can you buy us some
Oh, nothing, said Benny .
What do you make of this?
It’s seaweed or plankton.
I have to go back, Foaly.
That’s right, said Benny.
It was nothing like cows.
If she called him now, he
It’s pouring, said Benny.
I haven’t done anything! 
Would you like to see it?
That’s right, said Henry.
What do you have in mind?
Do you like what you see?
If I lose, then Im crazy.
He led the way, running .
Can you breathe in there?
At Space Camp, do you get
Do you know what his name
He must have, said Benny.
They must be interesting.
What are you doing here? 
Alden, looking at Benny .
Ask me anything you want.
He had been thinking only
It’s none of my business.
Let’s name him Stockings.
Do you know what it says?
Can you believe the luck?
That’s what it really is.
Lambchop, I love cooking.
Something to feed to him.
That’s neat! cried Benny.
Can you petrify the bomb?
ButI have certain skills.
He has almost everything.
Do you remember what Mrs.
Yes, that’s an old penny.
He doesn’t care any more.
It’s all right, said Mike.
I have to carry something.
That’s just what they are.
It’s old Myna, said Peter.
That’s just what we’ll do.
What do you think of that?
How do you know, Brainiac?
Shall I call the networks?
We can’t do a thing alone.
Oh, that would be telling.
I have a surprise for you!
Bates said, still smiling.
What do you know about it?
Yes, said Violet, smiling.
To be a hero, if you will.
No, it’s not, said Violet.
What’s up? asked Brother .
even if you wont admit it.
Alden, looking very white.
Please sit down a minute .
Alden, that’s a good idea.
That’s right, said Violet.
That farm is running down.
After all, it’s his house.
It’s only half past seven.
I should like to go first.
How could I have forgotten
What things? asked Benny .
He couldn’t help laughing.
What do you want, Mud Boy?
I have no Idea what to do.
It’s only dirty and dusty.
He patted Mike’s shoulder.
That’s right, said Sister.
We are just thinking hard.
whole chickens and things.
It’s seaweed, cried Benny.
What if it comes after us?
Would you please be quiet?
I have pushed him too far.
I shall be working on them
I have no power insIde me.
Let’s look for a mouth and
We should certainly begin,
Let’s look in those ovens.
Do you have a reservation?
That’s right, said Peter .
Yes, Jessie was beginning.
Do we do our own cooking? 
now what shall we do about
Let’s tell him! Let’s tell
Let’s take the big kettle.
Guess! said Joe, laughing.
Ill tell you why, shall I?
That’s right! cried Henry.
Peter’s cave, said Benny .
He went to see the talking
Let’s watch for a landing.
implant I have in my head.
And why would you do that?
I have feelings, you know.
Thats why I have you guys.
I have their full backing.
the touch  can you use it?
It’s awfully hot up there.
What would that thing be? 
Play something, said Joe .
I have my limit, you know.
I have need of your magic.
Let’s run away from here! 
Let’s rest a little while.
What do you want me to do?
It’s full of milk already.
That’s right, Benny said .
And I have to buy flowers.
What would you have me do?
Ill starve to death if she
that if you saw the skull!
They are very interesting.
Neither can I, said Henry.
You may come to regret it.
I wouldn’t cry at nothing.
Carr will bring it to me .
Do you think so, Turnball?
Now, you must return home.
Do you think shell give us
If he had had a reception.
How shall we fix it, Joe? 
Carter can’t find a thing.
If indeed that man is your
You never forget anything.
He’s a wonder, said Benny.
Sister was telling because
Let’s catch the myna bird.
Do you understand,Artemis?
Never throw anything away.
Maybe, said Joe, thinking.
Do you visit your brother?
Can I have your autograph?
What do you mean not true?
Do you see the money, Luc?
He’s smiling, cried David.
Do you still have horses? 
Just like making mud pies.
Do you read, Mister Spiro?
Hiding? Why? asked Benny .
Would you like a nap, kId?
Moving? A tree? cried Joe.
It’s in a fisherman’s hut.
I can’t untie that string.
I will, if I can find him.
What can you tell us, Mrs.
We’re going to look at the
Morning? Grandfather said.
That’s right, said Jessie.
I can show you everything.
Can you see that, Captain?
I hear whistling, he said.
I’m going to say it again.
I have to go with Artemis.
If I had to walk away from
What do you mean, exactly?
Besides, it’s lots of fun.
What do you make of these?
So what do you want, Opal?
But I have nothing to say.
Oh, let’s go! said Benny .
Where’s Sam? asked Benny .
I forget all about eating.
What if it changes course?
He can remember everything.
Can you see the opposition?
His brother’s name is Jeff.
It’s a museum! cried Henry.
How do you like my shuttle?
I have some great material.
It’s lots of fun, you know.
You dont miss much, do you,
But what’s a shelter-half? 
That’s right, said the boy.
She’s always been that way.
What would you do with it? 
Could I have a brain tumor?
And I have mud in my socks.
It’s not that, said Violet.
What if Im stuck like this?
He should be easy to catch.
He’s my brother, said Mike.
If she had, then maybe this
Do you need a handkerchief?
I must go out now, said Dr.
You have to get used to it.
The men are starting to fix
So what do you fairies eat?
It’s okay, Ben, said Henry.
I have a challenge for you.
think of Benny’s big trout.
You’ll have to show us how.
Er—that’s right, said Mama.
That’s right, agreed Henry.
There’s nothing so homelike
Can you peel off your face?
The engineer is helping us.
It’s something made of tin.
That’s right, agreed Benny.
Do you remember everything?
That’s all right, said Jim.
I have to talk to Mr. Smith
I have to get back to work.
Just a second  I have mail.
How do you know I dont like
There’s the old Bean farm! 
It’s the twins, said Benny.
He couldn’t help laughing .
Would you fix it yourself? 
I believe in dreaming big! 
Do you see this expression?
It sounds very interesting.
Alive he may have been, but
Spelling! George answered .
They can’t sing, said Lars.
Oh, I have a point, Doctor.
What do you mean, a little?
He will fight over nothing.
Do you know how to stop it?
I’ll get on my rain things.
Let’s have the fishing rod.
I’ll bet it’s a helicopter.
We can see what’s going on.
He is coming from that way.
That’s for us! cried Marie.
That’ll stop his squeaking.
How do you know about that?
He’s down at the main gate.
He will die if I dont help.
I have done nothing, Damon.
She must miss a lot of fun.
No one’s there, said Benny.
I’m just fixing my tractor.
Nod once if you understand.
I’m not arguing, said Mike.
How do you feel about that?
Do you have a mobile phone?
It was more trouble for us.
What do you think happened?
But do you mean to be here?
I must take the dog to her.
I have an alter egonow too.
If you can guarantee me one
We’ll have to do something.
Henry’s strong, said Benny.
Let’s all go, cried Benny .
And he has already seen us,
And how do you figure that?
Oh, it’s as hard as a rock.
But money won’t do you much
That’s the truth, said Sim.
Maggie is coming with Jane.
Me, on the other hand, if I
I made four more, said Mrs.
Do you have any magic left?
That’s why it’s so strange.
What’s your name? Mr. Smith
Zito, when do you detonate?
How do you like the design?
But now I have decIded that
How do you know I’m Benny? 
But it looked as if there’s
McCarthy, shaking his head.
Palm trees and everything? 
You must go up and see your
That’s fine, said Mr. Smith
I have passports and visas.
Think of taking Peter home.
And if he was right, nobody
I’m taking her to my house.
What do you think, Jessie? 
That’s the secret, said Al.
But it’s nice to have it in
We must tell Sam about this.
What color do you want, Mrs.
Just pack your things first.
Just think how he must feel.
Let me give you something to
What do you know of the LEP?
Hello, he said, looking up .
That’s a grouper, said Lars.
We can’t stop now, said Joe.
We’ll let it grow some more.
I have earned it repeatedly.
Well, one evening, Mr. Smith
That’s funny, thought Benny.
I have Artemiss memories but
I have a few more questions.
We may have to wait all day.
He’s just one of the family.
Let’s find out, said Henry .
He’s a nice, gentle old man.
Let’s get six of each thing.
That’s a fine little violin,
I must have seven, said Mrs.
I have to step out just now.
That’s a fine idea, said Al.
How do you spell stupendous?
How do you like the present?
That’s enough! cried Jessie.
We haven’t anything to pack.
What are you talking about? 
That’s all right, said Lars.
I have no Idea, saI'd Holly.
He wanted things done right.
What do you mean? asked Joe.
I have to object, Commander.
It’s wonderful, said Jessie.
He wants to do things right.
That’s exactly what we want.
He’s not here! they called .
That’s right, said Mr. Smith
Let’s go on with our picnic.
Do you think you cando that?
It has just stopped blowing.
It’s a fishhook made from an
Do you think so? asked Mike.
Working for us? asked Benny.
Something is sure to happen.
Then it’s agreed, said Papa.
Why do you have to go home? 
I want to ask him something.
Why do you want to go there?
Do you want some help, mate?
She did not shake any more .
They are in the oven baking.
Do you like to go exploring?
Do you know who bought him? 
Would you look at that,Theo?
Do you see what is under it?
Do you need to take a break?
Benny! Henry said, blushing.
Would you like to call home?
She could not help laughing.
The swing seemed to be ver y
That’s right, too, said Joe.
Taking the Bear Trail trip? 
Everything goes! said Papa .
If you do, itll be too late.
I think that’s why he wanted
From which land do you hail?
It’s all right, said Jessie.
Listen, Orion, if you really
Talking horse? asked Benny .
Sand paintings? asked Benny.
can you think that, Artemis?
Who do you think Im calling?
That’s where we are staying.
Who knows who is listening? 
Don’t bring the box up here.
Where’s Larry? asked Henry .
Maybe something will happen.
Where do you suggest I melt?
Don’t stand there knocking! 
That’s why Bill disappeared.
Coming around the corner was
But nobody has said a single
You maygo back to class now.
But that’s the general idea.
Chi-Chi’s diamonds! said Al.
But nothing ever came of it.
Darn foolish, if you ask me.
But if your weapons are out 
That’s what I say, said Mrs.
But it’s not a yellow house.
You must have a secret idea.
But who do you think he was?
But you’ll stop in about ten
But what shall we do when we
Now it’s my turn, he cried .
You dont believe me, do you?
Captain Root, if you please.
Can you zoom in on his face?
If I may have your passport?
Can you switch off the mike?
Can you talk to the animals?
Its not as if I saI'd Dom-o 
No more chocolate if you do.
Yes! That’s a good question.
Oh, do you dare? asked Hal .
If  I may ask you something?
Do you have anything to say?
Oh, let’s go home, she said.
Your lap is getting smaller.
So what do you want from me?
Never, never! We must be far
Oh, it’s Al! Come right in! 
There’s nobody there, Benny.
No, not if it’s worn smooth.
Diggums, if Im not mistaken.
It will look like nothing at
Oh, I think I have a choice.
She has too many principles.
She has trouble with stairs.
There must be four lobsters.
Do I have your word on that?
But I’ll tell you something.
that’s why we went up there.
And I have to tell Carl too!
What would you like to know?
That is better than telling.
Whatdo you think, gentlemen?
If your guinea pig goes Arr!
Tell us everything you know.
A secret, said Joe laughing.
If you hurry, he saId, none.
that’s what I’m going to do.
Let’s tell Sam first anyway.
Every day you must send me a
He has hunted me ever since.
then shall I cease to exist?
That’s right, said Too-Tall.
Has he done anything wrong? 
If youre a good boy, Ill buy
What’s a dump? asked Benny .
All this talk about nothing.
Do you have something for me?
What do you know! said Myna .
Do you have the money, Damon?
That’s the nearest motel, and
What do you know! said Henry.
what’s more, he’s still gone.
That’s a good climb, he said.
Let’s paint the outside, too.
So how do youknow old Vishby?
Yes, it was a terrible thing.
we haven’ta single newspaper.
I have one card left to play.
How can you live without her?
Do you have any Idea what its
What do you know! said Benny.
Might I have this photograph?
Whatdo you think youre doing?
I have a fungus, saI'd Ragby.
That’s just like Grandfather.
Benny, said Henry, laughing .
Happy Father’s Day, Mr. Smith
Then you must stay, said Mrs.
Why else would you have kIds?
If she had years left to her.
Might I have a word with you?
Bring them down to the beach.
Please, Henry, begged Jessie.
He can handle growing things.
After all, I have beenArtemis
He could put on new shingles.
Bill’s awake and he’s hungry.
That’s just it, said Jessie .
What would you do, dumb-bell?
Right, said Jessie, laughing.
That’s just fine, said Henry.
How would you like to adopt a
She’s a mother to you, Benny.
Carr laughing, you could not.
Whaja-bringme? they screamed.
What if I gave you a way out?
The Money Man is going to buy
That’s all right, said Benny.
I could hardly help laughing.
If he knew who hismother was.
There’s a letter in the hole.
Carter? Do you mean Mr. Smith
Now he has two things on you.
You didn’t have to change it.
A fine-looking man, said Jim.
I brought along a few things.
She’s wonderful, said Henry .
That’s all right, said Henry.
I have to think of something.
He is going a little too far.
There’s a light! said Violet.
You don’t mean Bill, do you? 
David needs something to eat.
You must keep your eyes open.
Yes, said his mother smiling.
He must be a very strong man.
There’s another! cried Benny.
Dart, would you like a snack?
What do you know of my lemur?
He doesn’t sing, said Violet.
No, it’s a vase, said Violet.
But he’s looking for trouble.
I should say not, said Henry.
We have been waiting for you.
I didn’t want to stop to eat.
There’s always room for you! 
How many buckets do you have?
He has been nominated for the
Let’s go, Mother, said Peter.
He may not be completely out.
How do you like your garden? 
There’s Joe now, said Jessie.
That’s this hot sun for you! 
Are you going to put in two? 
He was laughing at something.
Trust me, I have photographs.
If you can get one out to me.
It’s one o’clock, said Lovan.
That’s right, said the clerk.
I want to show you something.
Is something wrong, Stanley? 
Isn’t it exciting? said Mike.
What’s that for? asked Henry.
Are you making a chair seat? 
Here is the dead-man’s pedal.
That’s right, Ben, said Mike.
I have faith in you, Captain.
Hands off, please, said Mama.
It’s only Willie, Henry said.
Let’s do Violet’s seat first.
This is too exciting for you.
Dried everything, said Benny.
Anything else? asked Jessie .
Let’s drive down, said Henry.
Do you want the window open? 
I have a proposition for you.
That’s where I would have put
He will do nothing but whine.
Why do you want Artemis back?
They were standing up, neatly.
We must be careful about that.
If you could use your weapons.
It’s your money and your mine.
I have explained this, Basset.
Here’s the key, said Mr. Smith
Except now I have a human eye.
What shall we do now, Jessie? 
Here’s a kettle, said Violet .
It’s exactly what I want most.
I have that effect on females.
my things too! cried Brother .
Well, I’m going to get my dog.
Good morning, Henry, said Mrs.
He was talking to another man.
That explains a lot of things.
You stop, or you’ll have to go
Where do you need us to stand?
We’ll have to get to Mr. Smith
Kane’s legs and out the door .
Where do you need to be, Cube?
That’s not a girl, said Benny.
I’ve been waiting and waiting.
It’s four o’clock, said Henry.
Good morning, Henry, she said.
The box was open this morning.
here is Freddy Willet’s name! 
How do you know what to call? 
How do you know? asked Benny .
You must wake up and walk now.
You shouldn’t say such things.
Do you think it was a rabbit? 
It’s for you, Benny, she said.
How do you know these secrets?
I have a piggly-wiggly wedgie!
Now she has them, crowed Root.
Now we must pay for it, Henry.
Can I carry one? asked Benny .
Can you imagine kissing Moose?
What’s up now? Henry wondered.
I must think about this alone.
I am going first, that’s sure.
I can see that we are going to
Gas engine, if you believe it.
I have something to tell you  
That’s right, Benny answered .
Should I have a word with him?
Do you all have so many teeth?
Listen, kIdsI have great news.
What do you think youre doing?
I have to talk to Annie, maam.
I have just about enough for a
You dont believe that, do you?
Look out, it’s hot! said Myna.
He has three toothpicks in his
That’s right, Ben, said Henry.
How old do you think Maria is?
You are doing the right thing.
We can’t take too many things.
We must walk fast, said Henry.
That’s too bad, said Mr. Smith
That’s why he didn’t like him.
You may address me as Captain.
Like if youre in a bad mood, I
What do you think of the suit?
That’s very funny, said Henry.
It’s all right, Bill! It’s all
It’s like a race, said Benny .
Foaly, record this, would you?
You’ve got something, Violet! 
Take the things, said Willie .
Let’s look around, said Benny.
I have to get it out of there.
He came running over to Benny.
Alden, getting up, we must go.
I have no clue whats going on.
Let’s call it Surprise Island.
His playing is just wonderful.
As if I needed to be reminded.
All right, that’s enough, Mrs.
So you believe she has a gift?
Buddy, do your Shirley Temple.
Yeah, Annie whispers, she has.
There may be something inside.
Do you know how many times Ive
I never heard of such a thing.
I have no desire not to exist.
I was going to give it up too.
I ought to have been watching.
Browning when dinner was over.
I’m going for the Coast Guard.
He’s brother to the Cook boy’s
I have a duty to your parents.
They had not expected anything
Do you see what Im getting at?
I have to get up, she thought.
I’ll bring you a present, too.
Thank you, my dear, for sewing
Do you think its him, Artemis?
Do yourironing while Im at it.
We must have a fire for beans.
Do you mean business trouble? 
All in a day’s work, Mr. Smith
They could be Peter’s parents.
Benny’s eyes were almost shut.
They come in here because it’s
It is land, said Lars smiling.
Oh, please don’t, cried Benny.
That’s nice, Joe, cried Benny.
I’m enjoying them, said Benny.
How can you say its poppycock!
Begin unloading it, would you?
If it hurts him, it hurts him.
I have things on my mind here.
What do you know! cried Henry.
Larry, Larry, he kept saying .
She has really built you up to
If you can hear me, go faster!
Let’s go fishing! cried Benny.
Let’s go inside, said Jessie .
Let’s pole the boat in, Henry.
I should think so, said Henry.
Do you want that to happen to 
I don’t see a thing, he said .
That’s no mouse, Ricky yelled.
We need spoons for everything.
Yes, it must cook for a while.
No, I have not, protested Luc.
It’s just a tiny one, said Dr.
What do you mean, cleared out?
What do you know! said Henry .
You want to be demons, do you?
If he cant work, neither can I.
The running boy! cried the man.
But what do you want oats for? 
Benny! cried Jessie, laughing .
But Lovan’s last name is Dixon.
You’ll have to get off the bed.
You think of everything, Benny.
I have to read this one, Foaly.
Pyrenean, if he wasnt mistaken.
It’s too hot in the lighthouse.
what’s plankton, young feller? 
But I know whatI’m going to do.
You dont know anything, do you?
It’s lots more fun to buy them.
I have to get powdered milk for
Save everything you aren’t sure
That’s fine with us, said Mama.
wasnt sure if shed do it again.
If you dont trust me, stay here
I do not like living in a town.
Oh! cried Jessie, jumping back.
She seemed to be very pleased .
then we’re going to the movies.
All sorts of things! Papa said.
Benny looked over his shoulder.
I have my eye on you, Flanagan.
I’m going to try, answered Joe.
Schoolteaching! Are you crazy? 
Whaja-bringme? Whaja-bringme?! 
It’s settled, then, said Henry.
You have to play these fellows.
Alden, to everyone’s surprise .
Oh, yes, said Benny looking up.
If he confessed, she would hate
If you do, we lose him forever.
We’re going to visit Aunt Jane.
If you doenter, I will go free.
I dont suppose I have a choice.
Raining! said Henry to himself.
Bring back what you don’t want.
How do you know? asked Jessie .
That’s the way I feel, said Dr.
This morning I was just sort of
Which tunnel do you like, Theo?
That’s the way he is, said Jim.
Let’s walk over into the woods.
That’s the torpedo! said Benny.
Do you still have the gumption?
Do you suppose hes your Seeker?
Let’s go downstairs and you can
How do youkeep tabs on the LEP?
They were just trying to help, 
It’s just right for you, David.
Very well, said Alice laughing.
That’s all right! cried Jessie.
He thinks I can’t stop talking.
He stopped eating for a minute.
What’s his name? asked Violet .
Don’t stop at the next station.
This auction is no fun anymore.
How can you say it was rubbish?
Take everything out, cried Joe.
Where are you going from here? 
To think of having a real guest
Let’s all go down, cried Benny.
Stop yelling in my ear, Goose! 
I must cook for my family, too.
Here’s my seat, cried Isabelle.
Let me have a swing, too, Mike.
There’s your tunnel, said Sam .
Yes, said Al, I do the cooking.
It’s Mike’s house! yelled Benny
We did get something! he cried.
If I could turn back the clock 
Do you speak English, creature?
What’s your idea? asked Henry .
Where do you guys play exactly?
What do you mean? asked Violet.
How do you do, said both boys .
Meaning yourself? asked Henry .
Let’s go up to the woods today.
Just like fishing, said Benny .
Can you please translatefor us?
Think nothing of it! said Mike.
If I open my mouth, Im putting 
Why is Al running? Benny asked.
Why would you give me a chance?
Can you say youre sorry, Stink?
What should we do without you! 
Do you want the straight truth?
Buthe might remember something.
I shall have to live somewhere.
How do you suggest I fetch him?
That’s all we want, said Henry.
He has to know that, doesnt he?
Why do you suppose? said Mama .
You can touch mine if you wish.
Do you understand what I mean? 
Yes, you must have, said Benny.
Close your eyes if you love me.
He could carry a lot of things.
Let’s go to bed, said Mr. Smith
Cole is coming? said Aunt Jane.
Yes, that’s so, answered Henry.
Will everyone please sit down? 
What do you want to talk about?
How many do you think shes had?
Yes, that’s right, said Violet.
Come on, let’s eat! said Benny.
What do you mean you wont play?
Let’s count them, cried Benny .
Who do you suppose is living in
He saI'd hed kill me if I told.
Don’t give him any more, Henry.
Three settings if you dont mind.
Over there, said Mike, pointing.
See that man waiting to meet us?
And what do you answer yourself?
Here’s the key to the back door.
I’ll cook you anything you want.
Maybe if I get you angry enough.
What do you plan to do now, Mrs.
He’s a wonderful swimmer! Look! 
What do you really think of him?
If you continue to fireball that
Where are you going? asked Papa.
Do you wish to call Phils Pizza?
Don’t start the picnic fighting.
That’s one of my lobster floats.
He’s almost a hundred years old.
Alden said, smiling to himself .
After all, it’s almost midnight.
That was a smart thing to think.
A wave is coming! Henry shouted.
He realizes he has been tricked.
Actually, I have some ointment  
What’s that? asked Grandpa Cole.
What do you want me to say here?
That’s right, Benny, said Henry.
Please let me do that, said Joe.
The one I am going to work for? 
He has a dose of food poisoning.
What is that thing? asked Mike .
I have read several transcripts.
The Money Man’s going to pay her
I have a smell test, saI'd Judy.
He is fine at getting out clams.
That swing might break suddenly.
He patted the dog’s smooth head.
Let’s pile all the dishes in it.
What shall we do? asked Jessie .
Professor, can you make it down?
Important? What can I tell you? 
Look what’s coming! cried Benny.
I have had enough of you, Nzall.
It’s too much, said Max at last.
I never heard of sand paintings.
I think it must have been Peter.
Here’s a queer one, said Jessie.
Everything was as neat as a pin.
I have felt it, saI'd the voice.
Sure, said the officer, smiling.
not a thing happened except that
Always doing something exciting.
Let’s wash my shell, said Mike .
Tell them? said Marie, laughing.
All the children were cheering .
That’s right, son, said the man.
What’s the matter? asked Henry .
I think he has magic of his own.
Get kIdnapped every day, do you?
The rain was still pouring down.
Going away to sea, said Willie .
You see a staging must not fall.
Oh, I should say two dozen ears.
No, said Hal, laughing a little.
We girls must go and get dinner.
But do you think they have food?
What do you have up your sleeve?
I do wish she’d be more careful.
No, said Rita, shaking her head.
So English, if you wouldnt mind.
I dont know if he understood me.
We had to see about Mike’s fire.
It was true, but I have changed.
No, but I’m going to work on it.
If I can get him alone, he saId.
That’s a good idea, said Jessie.
If it hadnt been for me, youd be
It’s just a blanket on some hay.
That’s a funny name, said Benny.
I hope we won’t forget anything.
You think of everything, Violet.
I’m not really sure of anything.
There’s our island! cried Henry.
We’ll have lots of other things.
Can you imagine those headlines?
I am not going either, said Joe.
Can you do anything about those?
What can it be? wondered Jessie.
What a queer thing, said Violet.
Now I am going to surprise Jane.
That’s all right, said Mr. Smith
That’s very fine, said Mr. Smith
a dog, too, said Lovan, smiling.
Can I run the Diesel again after
What are you going to do first? 
I have to put it on a long fork.
Yes, yes, yes, we must remember.
Since when do you listen to her?
That’s enough, said Grandfather.
Come on, they are looking at us.
How much do you think it put her
I can’t see anything back there.
It’s like a chew-stick mountain.
We have to put in four, he said.
You believe that I have a heart?
You can guarantee that, can you?
Well, that’s right, she doesn’t.
It’s a fine idea and a kind one.
Lets see if your generation does
There he sat, reading the paper.
Something is wrong, cried Henry.
Why, it’s huevos rancheros! Mrs.
Would you stake your life on it?
What do you mean two short guys?
Wood with a loving look at her .
Do you realize that all of these
Would you have disobeyed orders?
I like to put things together to
Let’s all go to the restaurant! 
They were going tothrow it away.
Do you need to go see the nurse?
That’s the day I’d like to come.
There might be something for us.
I have a name, you know, Julius.
But, it’s a tree! said Brother .
That’s lots of fun, said Jimmy .
Holly, why do you do this to me?
Isn’t this exciting! cried Mike.
I’m going to try it, said Benny.
Then, once he has done our dirty
Do you know what a skeleton is? 
Do you know something, Bertholt?
We may have to wait a long time.
Wouldn’t you get tired of making
It’s high tide, and we’re stuck.
It’s a lot of nonsense, ofcourse.
It’s cigarette smoke, said Henry.
I was coming, anyway, said Benny.
If you say so, the pilot replied.
If you cant accomplish that, then
I understand the whole thing now.
We have to have baked beans, too.
If I remember correctly, you were
I should say the whole family was
We must keep our eyes open, Mike.
If I moved, his claws dug deeper.
Is that the school bell ringing? 
It’s just as well, said Mr. Smith
I have to go somewhere and think.
I think he is planning something.
We can probably buy things there.
If it were me, I'd bury me alive.
That’s the thing we have to save.
I think we must stay, said Alice.
It’s all right, Al, called Benny.
If you dont go in, many will die.
We are making money, said Jessie.
We can stop if he gets too upset.
We don’t want any more accidents.
That’s what I wanted to find out.
I never thought of such a thing! 
We have to build a staging first.
There must be a bed, said Violet.
I think you may have a condition.
Wait till morning, said Mr. Smith
That’s right, said Joe, laughing.
That’s why I think he is a thief.
If its been sent, I can trace it.
I won’t need a thing, said Larry.
Uh, if you approve, yourhighness.
Ingenious, if I do say so myself.
It’s now or never, thought Henry.
What do you think that was about?
He went to see the talking horse.
Here’s another thing, said Henry.
That was our teacher’s name, too.
Of course, said Jessie, laughing.
Oh, dear! said Violet sitting up.
He’s got a boat! whispered Henry.
But he doesn’t know anything yet.
What do you mean? asked Mr. Smith
He looked at the laughing family.
What if its the Jichmach who win?
Now what do you know! said Henry.
Let’s have that race! said Benny.
What if she was getting visitors?
You may be fireproof, but are you
You may have a look if youd like.
But we just found a letter saying
He must be somewhere, said Benny.
bruises, if you know what I mean.
How much will it be? asked Henry.
do you think we live underground?
Shall I tell you something, Arty?
How many do you think Mom and Dad
What can it be? wondered Violet .
Just how dumb do you think weare?
Are you going to do the cooking? 
See, thereis one coming in today.
He’s white with black and sort of
He’s out with my brother Pat now.
What do you make of these shapes?
He’s joking, Benny, said Jessie .
He’s my best friend, said Benny .
Because of you I have my parents.
What do you have to bargain with?
Honey, I think its better if you 
That’s a funny thing, said Benny.
Do you plan on using the convict?
Maybe it’s a rabbit, said Henry .
Do you notice anything different?
Which Mud Man do you most admire?
Where’s your house? asked Henry .
Stop worrying! said Brother Bear.
Everyone was dripping with water.
Speedy’s loose! Kevin announced .
Do you like my little laboratory?
Something happened in your house.
Do you think its the same person?
Moore, putting down the baskets .
Do you think you can handle that?
Milk and more bananas, said Lars.
Someday I am going to be a nurse.
Don’t stop to talk, cried Jessie.
Do you wish to call Police Plaza?
Whose canoe do you think this is?
Yes, she can, said Henry smiling.
So how do you propose we get this
No, said Lovan, shaking her head.
No, he’s not a talker, agreed y .
Let’s try to find a better place.
Yes, that’s right, said Mr. Smith
You be thinking of what you want.
What will happen if I get caught?
Let’s rest a long time, said Joe.
Would you really? asked Mr. Smith
Do you know how to use a compass,
Straight as a string, said Benny.
Everything is ready, said Jessie.
No, I have a contact in Interpol.
Yes, each of you must take a bag.
So that’s why she is so worried! 
So that’s what it was! cried Joe.
That’s it, said Henry to himself.
I have a special job for you, Mo.
Real sick, if you catch my drift.
wasnt sure if he would, or could.
JW replied, I have sent for them.
I have administered shots before,
That’s right, Jessie, said Benny.
now is that I have a job for you.
Well, that’s good, said Mr. Smith
Alden, still staring at the sign.
I have a possible emergency here.
thickest Mud Men I have ever met.
We’ll have to wait until morning.
Alden, smiling at the little boy.
Well, we are all going on a trip.
I guess so, said David, laughing.
Well, there’s Henry, said Jessie.
And even if its nuclear generator
Phillips, going out last of all .
That’s an idea, said Grandfather.
I’m going to think of some way to
Quite an exciting town! he said .
I can do Taiwanese if you prefer.
y was a fine looking, clever boy.
And Theresa, you may as well hear
Well, let’s be going, said Henry.
All I have to do is open my hand?
I have a few underworld contacts.
And how many beetles do you have?
A boat is coming! called Jessie .
Here’s a lot of junk, said Benny.
Didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.
There’s no grass here, said Benny.
Uh, would you like somegreat food?
Hall knows absolutely everything! 
Thanks for telling me, said Lovan.
No, said Jessie, shaking her head.
Handy if you get shot with a small
Let’s save all the shells we find.
Dad, do you have to saw so loudly?
Piper looks as if she might burst.
I shall stop if it begins to tear.
You cant collect it if youre dead.
He is chewing the table to get the
It’s called a ‘womb,’  said Mama .
I have to get my dad and Mr. Smith
He has a plan, she saI'd to Foaly.
Now this is interesting! he cried.
What else can you put in her hand?
Yes, that’s one, said the captain.
I have a loaded diaper right here.
I’ll tell you something else, too.
Cook smiling, I know all about it.
I should say I did! replied Henry.
He has a small, well-trained crew.
Can you seal the tunnel behind us?
I’m going down to see, said Benny.
with him as if he were her cousin.
Maybe the horse is Dolly’s sister.
Would you like to borrow ourcanoe?
The frankfurter was burning on one
Mulch and I have our first client.
to protect me and now she may die.
Actually, it’s mine, honked Goose.
It’s a mystery still, said Jessie.
Do you really need all this stuff?
A sailor would say, Ship’s School.
Do you want to know what that was?
Why else would you have brought us
The dog must have heard something.
Mike’s mother hasn’t any home now,
Willet must have been here before.
Maybe there’s a name on the paper.
Something new is always happening.
Do you think I like this, Captain?
With fingers I can… Knit a scarf !
, do you know anything about this?
Well, it’s possible, said the boy.
What’s the matter? called Violet .
I have an Idea, brother, she saId.
I'd save my charges if I were you.
there’s the kitchen, yelled Benny.
Yes, said Benny, nodding his head.
I think I may have started atrend.
Good night! said Henry, laughing .
I think Joe is going to marry her.
Do I have to spell it out for you?
It’s too bad we like to talk, Ben.
Where do you keep the dead people?
Do you know who the other boy is? 
Some men were building a driveway.
Do you mean beer, and cheese pies?
To be riding in a caboose at last.
May I have your attention, please?
I’d like to see what’s down there.
I have him, thought the Irish boy.
There’s the station and the woods.
Oh, it’s so hot! said Benny Alden.
He’s very gentle and very careful.
It’s growing in a special place in
Browning, taking thecompany chair.
I don’t see a thing, said Violet .
That’s what happens when you move.
That’s why I want to see it again.
Youre crazy if you help Al Capone!
That’s a fine name! said Mr. Smith
Holly, can you call me back later?
That’s a cat’s paw, said Mr. Smith
I may have fibbed that part a bit,
He’s been just hanging around ever
Oh, do you? Do you go to college? 
But I have to finish this project.
That’s her name, because Mr. Smith
Well, what do you know! he called.
Let’s close the door, said Jessie.
Oh, is it? asked Jessie, laughing.
If it hadnt been for the captain .
If it has a weapon, confiscate it.
I haven’t many things, said Mike .
How much do you know about demons?
That’s an egret, said Grandfather.
As if he needed another advantage.
One thing is the same, said Benny.
See what he has to say about this.
I can be polite when I have to be.
I saw the paper up at Aunt Jane’s.
If you broke that rule, you had to
Sh, sh! said the doctor, laughing.
We found some Indian things in it.
How do you get in? asked Mr. Smith
That’s a good question, said Mama.
Oh, let’s go upstairs, said Benny.
There is nothing in here, he said.
You’re making beads! cried Benny .
Our berry crop is ripe forpicking.
Just pull the lever a little more.
It has to stop to let people off! 
How do you know? whispered Benny .
You must carry Benny, said Jessie.
I never get tired of selling pies.
But maybe he can say other things.
He took Alice’s hand and held it .
I must work on the roofs tomorrow.
You must put them in your pockets.
But it’s very pretty, said Violet.
It’s for our museum, cried Benny .
You may be flat, but you are not a
But I saw him talking to Mr. Smith
She put her fingers in the water .
I have to go in, he saI'd tersely.
That train is going the other way.
If you dont see him, he aint here.
What do you mean, theres no pizza?
Once he has what he wants, he will
She may be just what Sister needs.
Oh, stop it, Mike, said his mother.
Then we will find out what’s wrong.
The first thing is, don’t get lost.
Aunt Jane must have shut that door.
Motion sensors, if Im not mistaken.
Can you move your fingers and toes?
Yes, said Benny, looking at Violet.
That’s the way to talk, said Benny.
You must eat your breakfast, first.
one of them is looking for uranium.
See if you like the way we operate.
Can you call me again in six weeks?
You’re going to have to stop that! 
Now what’s the matter? asked Benny.
See, I’m wearing shorts under here.
Do you think maybe he’s the daddy? 
One more thing I read, said Violet.
They were looking for uranium, too.
Its a waste of time, if you ask me.
You found some things that they had
Artemis nodded as if he dIdnt know.
She’s too proud to let me help her.
But first I have something for you.
No, not very, said Henry, laughing.
But there aren’t any more cannibals
But I thought you were going to be.
intervene even if he had been here.
There’s another surprise! Sam said.
there’s the red rock! cried Violet.
now he has to take a rIde in yours.
You must go down my step and watch.
Carter’s missing this, said Violet.
Yeah, if you say so, muttered Iggy.
It must be to step on, said Benny .
then why were the things put back? 
Do you guys have room for one more?
Do you have an insIde guy in Police
Shaw has been telling us about you.
If you wont buy me candy, how about
There must be some way, said Benny.
Its my job to find himif he exists.
That’s the only thing I don’t know.
Can you open these remotely, Foaly?
Oh, let’s, said Benny, jumping up .
Its not as if youre a beauty queen.
That’s the dinner bell, said Benny.
I wish I could, said Joe, laughing.
No, said the man, shaking his head.
So what’s wrong? her mother asked .
Oh, look who’s here! It’s Mr. Smith
That’s wonderful, Joe, said Violet.
My mother used to cook good things.
You always make the best of things.
So I did, replied Jessie, laughing.
But if he won, then he really lost.
If youre kIdding, Butler, thats not
And if you dont, at least Mr. Smith
Let’s go upstairs where the hay is.
Let’s go, Grandfather! said Benny .
That will give you something to do.
Let’s go now, said Benny suddenly .
I see it’s for sale, said Mr. Smith
He is very good looking, isn’t he? 
He might know something about tha t
Here’s a cherry pie I made for you.
Let’s get unpacked and have supper.
What do you mean, boy? asked Jeff .
Let’s do it outdoors, said Jessie .
What do you think we’ll find, Joe? 
Let’s go and see, said Grandfather.
Hello! Wait a minute! What’s this? 
Let’s sit out on the back platform.
Let’s take Spotty, too, said Mike .
I suppose that’s true, agreed Mama.
It’s as dark as a pocket down here.
It’s an Indian arrowhead! he cried.
Good morning, Sam! called Mr. Smith
Let’s take a close look at the hut.
Let’s make some more! cried Jessie.
I should say not, said Grandfather.
We are going to have a fine supper.
Thank you, said Jeff, driving off .
What? What’s that? asked Aunt Jane.
It’s been on that shelf ever since.
I have to put it in my book, Moose.
I can’t wait, said Henry, laughing.
Well, said Benny, that’s all right.
That’s just the day you can’t come.
I can come back later if youd like.
Just how stupI'd do you think I am?
That’s enough, old boy, said Henry.
I have of course been aware of you.
I have never spent a day in prison.
Why not? said Joe, turning it over.
I have outstayed my welcome on this
We worked really hard this morning.
It’s what a whale eats, said Benny.
I have so manythings to write down.
We don’t want to keep them waiting.
How do you do? said Benny politely.
That’s a queen’s necklace, said Dr.
Just what do you think youre doing?
Let’s build a house, then, said Dr.
He’s going to faint, said Mr. Smith
It’s high time you learned to read.
I am going to New York soon anyway.
Hungry, Mike? asked Henry laughing.
What business do you have up there?
That’s all he wanted, so we got it.
I heard you both snoring all night.
How long if you had some incentive?
I understand that’s what you want? 
Eva will know you should be let in.
I think she’s right, nodded Henry .
Long’s store some way, said Jessie.
It’s a good old kettle, said Benny.
Looks more like eggs, said Arthur .
Five words, said Violet, counting .
Flick the switch, if you dont mind.
It’s a tall wide cave in the rocks.
Maybe if I hadnt had to heal you at
Don’t say anything, Dave, she said.
For your information, I have a job.
Do you want to unpack yoursuitcase?
I have plotted the shortest course.
Do you remember how we saw something
Are you going to fish? asked Benny .
Oh, there’s a tiny crab! cried Mike.
Are you selling eggs? Maggie asked .
How old do you think she is, Maggie?
Would you do anything for me, Orion?
Indeed, said Mama, fanning herself .
I have to telephone a lot of people.
I will go in and start the dressing.
What about all the little things you
It’s Peter, Grandfather! said Henry.
Are you going to build a fire, Joe? 
I am Eduardo, the boy said, nodding.
I used to dream of having new shoes.
I have to watch Natalie, I tell her.
I knew that was a good thing to buy.
This is the only bus in the morning.
How do you come up with these plans?
Oh, look what’s coming! said Benny .
There he is, said Jessie, pointing .
There is a branch growing both ways.
But I am more interested in the sea.
He’s right, said Henry, looking in .
Jessie was thinking about what Benny
Browning, said Jessie, with a smile.
Do you mean ice-cream? asked Henry .
Do you really need that, Mister Day?
Ask him anyway, said Henry laughing.
I hope he can, said Henry, laughing.
be careful how much water you drink.
Oh, that’s a funny dish, said Benny.
You’ll have to see for yourself, Dr.
It’s a man’s bone, Benny! cried Joe.
Keep it boiling and do not leave it.
We have almost everything, said Pat.
Maybe it’s just a cave, said Henry .
A store man always knows everything.
We must get back to that breadfruit.
We must get a fire going right away.
I have never seen a force like this.
will turn round that I may smite it.
The man who was putting up the doors
It’s the vase on the desk! he said .
If youre innocent, why dI'd you run?
I have lately taken up line dancing.
We won’t need to hoe any vegetables.
Al says the next stop is a big city.
We shall have to go and see it soon.
Do you want to play button checkers?
That’s right, Miss Jessie, said Sam.
Let’s buy some bananas, said Jessie.
McGregor, smiling at the little boy.
Why do you call her ma? asked Benny.
We were just coming down to see you.
It’s a funny feeling, said Mr. Smith
That’s right, Jessie, said Mr. Smith
If you wanted to swing a stink worm.
Well, what do you know! he shouted .
I’m going to take them off the fire.
I’ve been thinking, Sam, said Benny.
I’m going to start this very minute.
If you dont take it, I will be back.
machine he hasnt gotten to work yet.
Osgood, looking at each one in turn.
That’s why I brought my boy with me.
I want to know just what’s going on.
It’s a big school and scout project.
I have enough to dokeeping you safe.
That’s quite a story, said Mr. Smith
That’s our Mike for you! said Henry.
The name I have given my little box.
I have switched these functions off.
If you fail, then the Retrieval team
Phillips, picking up a little cake .
I have a feeling that there could be
Amazingly, so do you, laughed Holly.
That’s like a baseball, said Benny .
I think she’s going to marry y Bean.
Now we must wash them, said Jessie .
I see, said Benny, nodding his head.
Its not as if she can tunnel her way
He may know, saI'd Opal placatingly.
Can you tell me any more about that?
What is he talking about?’ asked Dr.
Let’s make up a telegram as we ride.
He knew it would upset her if he had
You children must all go over to Dr.
What do you want people to call you?
You may escort us to the main level.
That must be where they baked bread.
Suppose it was pouring rain outside.
He smiled at Benny’s surprised face.
I would start working without eating
You have to get your own meals, Mrs.
Now, see if you can bring them back.
Now, if you would please observe the
There’s nothing for her to live for.
I think I lost the path coming over.
I think I’ll run over to Jim’s Place
That’s the way fog does, said Henry.
Thank you, it’s mine, quacked Duck .
Do you have a favorite hold, Milton?
Tell me something, Peter, said Mike.
You’d better let Joe do the fishing.
Yes, but I’m not going to, said Sam.
Let’s wait a little while, said Joe.
Let’s pack old clothes, said Jessie.
Cold! said Benny, walking out again.
Wait until you see the things he has
Yes, Benny, said Aunt Jane laughing.
Not if I can help it, thought Holly.
For a minute they said nothing more.
Today we are climbing this mountain.
Let’s put it down here, said Jessie.
I suppose it is the fish drying that
I met him this morning in the store.
Here’s the screwdriver, said Benny .
I may need them at a moments notice.
She hasnt even bought furniture yet.
That’s Miney! said Benny, laughing .
This time we will have to go without
I must be back in Egypt, he mumbled.
That’s what I thought, said Jessie .
I may be spellbound, but I am not an
She has gone to complete the Ritual.
But I could stun them if youdprefer.
I may be able to help you with that.
He’s a mystery, all right, said Sam.
You will have something to tell Max.
Maybe he wants to show the things to
I won’t go, said Aunt Jane, smiling.
What do you think theyll do with us?
Maybe I could have some more myself,
But it’s backwards to everyone else.
That thing alone is a great treasure.
That’s the way to cook a frankfurter.
It’s a good housekeeper, said Jessie.
She put her hand gently on Joe’s arm.
Please take some oats for Molly, too.
Rip out the detonator if you have to.
Nobody has said anything about Watch.
That’s the picture I saw! cried Mike.
It must be all right now, said Henry.
Shall I shut offlocal communications?
Something will turn up, said Jessie .
Let’s not worry, said Violet at last.
Let’s ask her tomorrow, Violet said .
Is it ever going to stop? he thought.
She has a fierce expression like shes
It’s a piece of a dish! shouted Joe .
Myna, sing ‘My country, ’tis of thee.
Nobody is going to cheat you, Freddy.
Just look at everybody going to work.
Long driving and his boy is with him.
It’s a very sad thing, said Mr. Smith
It’s an old bone, anyway, said Benny.
Let’s see what is in that empty room.
Just one question, however, if I may?
Its impossible if youve got a record.
It is probably something very simple.
So many exciting things, said Jessie.
I’m sorry, said Charley, coming back.
In a tin box—that’s right, Bill said.
She must be a lot of company for you.
So the question I have to ask is why?
Just think of having potatoes, Benny.
It was almost as if he never existed.
Now for the packing box, said Henry .
Oh, she can sing already, said Peter.
That’s what we came for, said Jessie.
Six dollars! called a woman’s voice .
Now we won’t have much packing to do.
Let’s get to work, then! cried Henry.
Our books for one thing, said Jessie.
Oh, said Benny, that’s a lot of work.
Pierre, can you come in here, please?
I’m all tired out with Mike’s doings.
Im beginning to wonder if shell ever 
Oh, no, she’s not afraid, said Peter.
I’ll stop by for you on the way home.
Just the thing, child, said Mr. Smith
It’s okay, you guys, Suzanne laughed.
More like male and female, said Mama.
It’s beginning to rain! cried Henry .
Say, isn’t this exciting! said Benny.
It’s all right with me, cried Henry .
That’s right—no clues, said Mr. Smith
Its not as if I saI'd the whole name.
Peter’s going to cry, thought Benny .
Yell if you want anything, said Lars.
You must go to bed, Violet, she said.
If he were, there would be a lot more
He’s my best friend in all the world.
Blue oil and water, if you dont mind.
But I have an important task for you.
We don’t have to wipe them, she said.
I have been giving this some thought.
What are we going to do today, Lars? 
All right, said Benny, sitting down .
Good dog, she said, patting his head.
If he was surprised, he hI'd it well.
And just how do you know all of this?
Did you want something? asked Benny .
Choke that centaur for me, would you?
There are so many pretty things here.
He never liked to wait for anything .
We’ll have totell the real story now.
Argon wondered if you had any kind of
Are you going to blast? asked Benny .
First, lets see if I can raise Haven.
His hiding place! whispered Mr. Smith
How many times do I have to tell you?
Ho-hum, said Benny looking at Henry .
How do you see the backs? she asked .
There is something else we must find.
If I get the opportunity, he thought.
I just love weddings, don’t you, Mrs.
Do you have the merchandise with you?
What a lot of things we’ll buy here! 
Hey, a Bucking Frog! shouted Brother.
Find anything, Henry? called Jessie .
Good work! cried Henry, much pleased.
I have possessed her from a distance.
Anything’s possible, responded Poppy.
Do you have to go home? asked Benny .
I have in my possession two ampoules.
If I cant see, how could Natalie see?
Do you have to be so chummy with her?
Do you know if the farm is for sale? 
How many ears shall we pick, Jessie? 
What do you mean, Jessie? said Henry.
Yes, we are living there this summer.
If he does, I can invent some excuse.
You dont believe any of this, do you?
Wonderful, Benny! said Joe, laughing.
What do you mean, boy? asked the man.
What a funny looking bag! said Benny.
Who are you? asked Benny looking up .
Aunt Lovan and I are making an Indian
Good for you! What else do you know? 
If you expose either one to the wIder
He hasnt activated his shadow-lights.
I see nothing but leaves, said Henry.
Are you going to sleep here tonight? 
For all the good it’s going to do us.
Do you think you can get them for me?
If you get blasters, so will the LEP.
Well, so he is, said Henry, thinking.
But we hope you know things we don’t.
What can we do in time to stop them? 
We’ll have to get your grandfather to
I guess you’ll have to, laughed Joe .
How do you avoI'd nose crashes again?
I may get one of these for the house.
He had to sell his talking horse,too.
Even if it took a couple of years, it
I have read the Peoples constitution.
I like to swim, and it’s so hot here.
We certainly have, said Joe, smiling.
The next thing to do is see Mr. Smith
And where do you think we should dig?
We are taking a trip in two cabooses.
I don’t mind going home, said Violet.
How do you know that? asked the man .
You shouldn’t be hungry, said Jessie.
Do you really think Mulch needs help?
He looked at one side of the opening.
Browning, looking at his old friend .
You kept making it bigger and bigger.
Do you remember what happened to him?
I have a captain Ineed to discipline.
But what if she doesnt let me take it
Do you really think this is the time?
Aren’t you going to eat your supper? 
Get all you can, and bring them here.
I shouldn’t think he would be working
Do you know anything about the couple?
Wed be kicked off the island if I were
Tonight we are going to sleep on beds.
You can have it, said Henry, laughing.
Yep! said Sister, holding up the ball.
What do you mean, sir, who let him on?
Holly, if you can hear me, take cover.
Why are you waving? asked Grandfather.
We must take a lot of food, said Lars.
THAT’s a silly question, Goose honked.
I'd listen if I were you, saI'd Koboi.
It’s our horse, after all, said Benny.
Just wait until you smell them cooking
She pushed him gently down the stairs.
over here! Yes, some more are missing.
How do you know there is such a thing?
And if it was, who was being insulted?
Well then, I have a few things to say.
Two more workmen were dragging a heavy
I have incorporated thermal, X-Ray and
Just what do you have in mind,Buttons?
Well, I have tried a good many things.
I should say he won’t! cried Mr. Smith
I see, said Henry, sitting down again.
I told you somebody was stealing eggs.
It’s a whine! cried Benny, looking up.
What do you mean I have let myself go?
It’s the station wagon! shouted Benny.
Good dog, she said, lying back again .
What do you mean its the map you drew?
You can do anything with your fingers.
He’s not a bad boy, is Mike, she said.
This is a very good painting, you see.
What’s this message, Al? asked Henry .
I was wondering what to do about milk.
We are trying to put in street lights.
So what do you want me to do about it?
It’s raining in this barn! said Benny.
Wood, let’s buy dishes! cried Violet .
What’s the matter? asked Grandfather .
He’s got two good legs and he can walk
I was afraid we wouldn’t see anything.
It’s about your own mother, after all.
I bet they are going around the world.
Holly would have groaned if she could.
More food, I suppose, said Aunt Jane .
That’s whatyour name should be, Katie.
What would I have to do to buy a wish?
Alden said, sitting down at the table.
Are we going to explore? asked Benny .
He built thathouse you are staying in.
Stink, I cant help it if Im not short!
What will Capone do to me if I refuse?
No, said Jessie, but I’m going to now.
If you could just bring the Cube here 
Then she will not worry about a thing.
Well, she said, what do you want now? 
He said history, said Henry, laughing.
I’m getting tired of this, said Henry.
He pulled to a stop at the tree house.
Let’s send him our message right away.
But I can hear it coming in somewhere.
That’s what we thought, said Mr. Smith
If she hadnt seen it, she wouldnt have
Where shall we go? she thought again .
It is almost morning, remarked Jessie.
Oh, isn’t this exciting! cried Jessie.
He has a hoof that no trap can resist.
why does Larry have to hide his work? 
Oh, it is so interesting! cried Larry.
She’s changed some, I guess, said Sim.
Five pounds of steak should be enough.
Oh, it’s enormous, Henry! cried Benny.
He grabbed Stanley’s hands and tugged.
He decided to say nothing right away .
I hope so, said the Captain, laughing.
He had several large fish on a string.
So do you, Dave, said Benny, laughing.
Where do you think Maria is right now?
I had better tell you one other thing.
We’ll have to pack soon, said Jessie .
Let’s have dinner from our own garden.
It’s made like a flatboat, said Henry.
So have I, said Grandfather, smiling .
No, she is coming here, said Mr. Smith
Maybe he is Sam’s brother, said Benny.
It’s more than funny, Ben, said Henry.
That hot soup would be just the thing.
said Jessie, holding Watch by a strap.
And even if it does swing back around,
That’s one reason I came home, said y.
There’s no place to eat on the island.
What do you think about that, my dear?
Oh, no, said Jessie, shaking her head.
There’s a railing all around the edge.
When I have the lemur, I will I will  
How good can you be at close quarters?
How long do you think youve been here?
Its better if you dontknow its coming.
Do you have to be sochummy with Piper?
I have had better tumbles with my dog.
That’s the only road except this path.
Let’s find some pine needles for beds.
Thank you for helping us, said Violet.
Let’s take out the bottle, said Henry.
Yes, I know, said Aunt Jane, laughing.
Jessie, bring in Watch, called Henry .
Who is selling it? asked Grandfather .
I have a responsibility to my brother.
Let’s go home, said Joe for an answer.
You’ll be leaving your friends behind.
You’ll have to cook, replied Mr. Smith
That’s right, said Henry to Aunt Jane.
You wouldn’t like riding in a caboose.
But then he saw two men coming along .
Cho-Cho used to own the talking horse.
I have to leave now, if you dont mind.
What’s our horse’s name? asked Benny .
Now we’re getting somewhere, said Joe.
Well, if you mean a skunk, yes I have.
Wilder-Smith, you see! He’s wonderful.
I have this effect on most humans too.
If he dI'd not, he would hate himself.
I have to take you to it, saI'd Ollie.
their own if it means a clean getaway.
there’s school tomorrow, said Violet .
She can watch meand see how it’s done.
You don’t have to, said the policeman.
Do you think it’s all right, Jessie, to
Calm down!  remember—it’s only a game! 
Just how many tongues can you speak in?
I have to go just the same, said Benny.
What are you going to do? asked Henry .
We might have to wait for quite awhile.
What are you going to cook for supper? 
I am sure Jane will bring her dog Lady.
You dont think it could be him, do you?
I’m getting enough for our supper, too.
I’m cold, too, said Violet, shivering .
That’s just what I said! shouted Benny.
Where is Henry going? asked Aunt Jane .
Well, it’s OK with me, he said at last.
Exactly right, said Lars, much pleased.
I’ll never get anything done, said Sam.
You’ll have to eat it now, said Jessie.
We’ll have to drink out of the bottles.
But why? I like to do things by myself,
Well, the staging is all done, said Dr.
Your eyes have to get used to the dark.
Even for humans, if you can believe it.
I’m going to be an FBI man, said Mike .
I have Foaly with me, and Artemis Fowl.
I don’t know, said the clerk, laughing.
Browning, my mouth fills up with water.
I have no choice, saI'd Artemis simply.
Fingers really are a must for tickling.
Joe ran up and took his uncle’s hands .
It’s time to ring the bell, said Benny.
At least someone isn’t making fun of me
Maybe, said Benny, smiling to himself .
Just don’t be disappointed, that’s all.
But I have to get you a visitors badge.
It’s that black car again! Benny cried.
I’ll be glad to let you know anything I
We’re watching Freddy most of the time.
Benny is missing! shouted Grandfather .
I have been looking for you, she said .
Well, I think so, said Jessie, smiling.
It’s very long, and the floor is a bed.
Because she’s a witch! That’s why not! 
I’d like some more onions, said Henry .
He was kneeling on the sand, watching .
He was off before they could stop him .
That’s what I think too, replied Henry.
He was in the way, barking at everyone.
There’s a great deal of it, said Henry.
Thank you, Benny, said Alice laughing .
It must have been Peter, whoever he is.
He took one and started unwrapping it .
He was going to take me back when I got
It looks as if she slept in herclothes.
If hes not here, we should go find him.
Please don’t eat it, Ben, Henry begged.
Do any of you know why all those things
What do you suppose she is doing here? 
Of course it’s yours, Mike, said Henry.
Hell be furious if he finds us outsIde.
What do you think it was? asked Jessie.
There’s only one place, Benny answered.
Let’s get going or we’ll miss the bus! 
Its all a bit convenient if you ask me.
Now would you please examine my mother?
He wasnt even sure if it was an insult.
Certainly, said the young man, smiling.
What do you think, Benny? asked Jessie.
Let’s go and pack, Jessie, said Violet.
If I just leave, there could be a riot.
Thanks, Eddie, for the fishing lessons.
If you dont answer me,so help me, Ill .
A man was helping someone out of a car.
If you manage that, youll be the first.
we can bring it to Violet, said Benny .
In the same cup, if he could manage it.
In good time, said Mama, sighing again.
Yes, that’s my name, said the stranger.
A good thing we found you! said Henry .
Let’s open the canned meat, said Mike .
If youre fighting over me, dont bother.
What shall I do? she whispered softly .
He has a deep crease between his brows.
What’s going on here? Katie cried out .
He sat down on the big vine and pushed.
He must hear something he doesn’t like.
Grizzle, he’s pretty excited right now.
Snowball’s all right, said Sam smiling.
What do you want me to say here, Jimmy?
If it wasnt for her I'd be biodegrading
Now, if you had saI'd a rubber hairpin.
Right now, I have to check the grounds.
Yes, that’s an idea, Benny, said Henry.
Yes, said Mama, calmly sipping her tea.
Then we’ll not have to live on bananas.
If she understood Artemis correctly, he
Uh-oh, what if she doesnt want to play?
Tell Benny to bring his dog, she said .
What’s the matter, Ben? asked Mr. Smith
We can’t see every building in one day.
That’s a good name for it, said Jessie.
This was a hiding place for ammunition.
Osgood, nodding, and this is the proof.
Let’s all have hot soup, said Mr. Smith
Honey, I don’t know if that’s possible.
It’s all right, Miss Jane, said Maggie.
Do you think his name is Joseph Alden? 
What’s your name? he called to the boy.
We have to make friends with him first.
Let’s take it all out, Jessie, he said.
Windows and doors don’t stop ourFreddy.
That’s a queer thing to do, said Benny.
Morse, said Grandfather, shaking hands.
Can I run this train all day? he asked.
I just thought the police should—I mean
Good! It’s a big one, said Grandfather.
People don’t tell where they are going.
I'd get there before then if I wereyou.
Nicole acts as if she knows everything.
That’s the funniest thing! said Jessie.
People keep saying someone at our house
That’s something to go on, said Henry .
And how do you know that, Master Wigby?
I want to tell my family it’s all over.
So we are going to Tahiti! said Henry .
He’s very smart, especially in science.
So that’s why I didn’t tell you before.
You were sitting with your back to them.
We’re going to have stew and a pudding! 
I’m sure he was worried about something.
You just look around, said Joe, smiling.
Let’s have some beans, Lars, said Benny.
Follow your dreams! said Poppy’s mother.
How do you like your steak? asked Larry.
What in the world do you want them for? 
That’s Grandfather for you, said Benny .
What can I say? You talk to her, Henry! 
She hasnt pitched a fit about it either.
Just what I was going to say, said Lars.
Maybe he could disarm it if he had a few
She will let you sit in the small dining
What was that baby’s name? asked Henry .
I don’t know, said Jessie, laughing too.
But we can’t prove a thing, said Henry .
I don’t like hot dogs, she said smiling.
Now that’s going to be a fine fire soon.
Let me ring the bell again, said Benny .
We’re exploring now, Benny, said Violet.
You go, girl! said Poppy’s grandparents.
She has some kind of hypnotizing skills.
Going, going, gone! said the auctioneer.
You four go to Rita’s and Joe and I will
I can see red, said Benny, twisting it .
I can smell something good! cried Benny.
I couldn’t stop talking for forty years.
Now this one, what do you think of this?
Holly and I have left loved ones behind.
I bet that’s a secret, too, said Benny .
Katie’s the secret weapon for our team! 
How do you know I wont double-cross you?
He missed his morning coffee and toast .
Let’s have a drink out of the waterfall.
He was sitting up eating his breakfast .
Look,they’re organizing a baseball game.
What do you know! cried Benny, staring .
But what do you want me to do about it? 
Keep watching him, said Benny excitedly.
I am not sorry, said the lady, laughing.
I dont know if I like the place, anyway.
If you dont, I have to take you with me.
I like having a houseboat named for me .
It’s everybody’s birthday, cried Jessie.
I read about gunpowder in Violet’s book.
Yes, that’s it, Grandfather, said Benny.
We don’t have to float, Ben, said Henry.
Do you suppose he has a nest somewhere? 
I think you are a very fine looking man.
That’s right, you would know, said Sam .
Things seem to happen just right for us.
I thought it was a strange thing to ask.
Only you’ll have to wait about one hour.
We are playing piñata, replied Eduardo .
Three: if in doubt, call your commander.
get back his talking horse, said Benny .
No, that’s another thing, said Mr. Smith
Do you think itll really break your jaw?
Miss Alden? said Jessie, turning around.
I have something for you, Mulch Diggums.
Do you think you could be ready, Benny? 
It’s only a dog, but I think he is hurt.
Do you think he can ever trust me again?
We have to get supper, too, said Benny .
If you find the stairs, call out and Ill
We know that, said Jessie, smiling too .
It’s mine, all mine, because I found it.
Really there is nothing more to see now.
Is she? asked Benny, giving a last yell.
If I heal Artemis, will I also damn him?
there’s our little house! shouted Benny.
that’s a tiny little fish! cried Violet.
And do you want to know how he lays low?
Do you have any phantom guIded missiles?
If I had a neck, I could have broken it!
Alden! said David, putting out his hand.
Nod if you can read this, the text read.
Then in a minute he said, It’s all done.
Right now, we are trying to find Lovan’s
If it wasnt for you, I would have missed
That’s what I thought, too, said Henry .
There is a stove and a frying pan on it.
I will cart stones or rocks or anything.
Do you know how to thin out vegetables? 
I wonder if it’s a bear, thought Benny .
I wish we had more kettles, said Jessie.
They wouldn’t hide if they weren’t doing
Things always work out all right for us.
They smelleven worse now, if you ask me.
Ith thtill thtuck, she said, showing Dr.
Its almost as if she wants to be caught.
So stay right where you are, if you know
Its not as if I can report you toanyone.
Not more than I do! said Lars, laughing.
And how do you suggest we go up exactly?
You’ll be busy finding something to eat.
I’m getting interested in this woodshed.
I have more protection than a presIdent.
But you have to becareful, just in case.
Who’s coming now? It’s a woman in a car.
If you rented storage in a cleaner lane 
But you’ll have to wash your own dishes.
You do very well with your housekeeping.
I’m going to have a pizza, said Jessie .
Well, that’s his lookout, said Mr. Smith
Maybe there is something wrong up there.
Maybe there is something on the caboose.
I have hundreds of human movies on file.
The Coast Guard is coming fast this way.
Well, snake, old boy, what do you think?
Oh, said the Thin Man, thinking it over.
You’ll have to learn to like fish, Mike.
Well, we are going to eat, said Jessie .
Benny won’t mind washing dishes in that.
It’s eight o’clock, and I’m sleepy, too.
Well, well! said Henry, smiling at Mike.
That’s neat, said Benny, Ship’s School! 
I have a feeling visitors are on the way.
I’ll put on my swimming suit, said Henry.
Its WAY more official if you have a name.
You go, girl! said Poppy’s grandparents .
But let’s go back to the houseboat first.
Yes, that is the first thing he would do.
The cherries are cooked in the dumplings.
Well, thank you, said the lady, laughing.
What do you really think of Artemis Fowl?
Let’s call this Gull Island, Benny said .
They are very interesting, said Mr. Smith
We’re digging on the wrong side, I guess.
Let’s dig and see if we can find another.
He’s a pretty cool dog, George admitted .
If you can be anywhere, why are you here?
You mean Peter’s father? whispered Mike .
Count the seconds if your clocks stopped.
I have already begun to formulate a plan.
Good! Let’s go and find Sam, Benny said .
Let’s teach our baby to fly, said Goose .
There’s your store, said Benny, pointing.
He couldn’t help wondering about two men.
He’s a smart boy, your Larry, said Henry.
If it was my business, would you tell me?
He certainly said the right thing to Ben.
Alden, or he would have told us about it.
Alden, handing the violin back to Violet.
He says something else, said Grandfather.
If it dIdnt exist, I'd have to invent it.
Is that anything? asked Violet, pointing.
Didn’t you see the fishing rods Mr. Smith
No, it’s at my father’s house, said Sim .
Isn’t this fun? cried Benny, hoeing away.
No, said Eddie, shaking his head, no dog.
And maybe I would, if it werent for that.
If she wasnt right there, in her harness.
Burping a song kinda sounds like a kazoo.
Well, well! he said, Nothing to forgive! 
It doesn’t, though! said Violet laughing.
She took the rocking chair, and Mr. Smith
I guess this story of yours must be true.
Yes, I know, said the older man, smiling.
I’m on my way to Farmer Ben’s for apples.
So just stay quiet and do your exercises.
But she must have liked the idea, really.
There’s just one thing wrong, Henry said.
I’m going to ring the bell, added Benny .
That’s the way it always is, said Maggie.
There’s Major’s little house, said Benny.
Do they really, now? said Lars laughing .
Well, there’s a little lever by the desk.
If he turns round, then you can stun him.
Nuclear power source, if Im not mistaken.
So I can, said Violet, very much pleased.
There’s a little microscope on the table.
Not in the neck for me, if you dont mind.
Follow your dreams! said Poppy’s mother .
If you tell a soul, I will hunt you down.
How long are you going to stay, Mr. Smith
Well, I don’t know, said Henry, thinking.
At least if I heal him there is a chance.
after that I’m going to try out that bed.
Just one more question and then we’ll go.
Now I only hope there is something in it.
She has no Idea, Piper answers for Annie.
We can’t go back, sir, said Al, frowning.
How do you know thats where the beast is?
Katie wished she could be more like that.
We can presume she has upgraded the probe
What do you know about that! said Henry .
It’s good to talk to you again, Mr. Smith
I love to bake pies the best of anything.
Do you see the pail hanging over the fire
I have shot Artemis twice since then, and
What advice would you give a young dwarf?
Should we be afraid, Lars? asked Violet .
Just a little rain, said Benny, laughing.
She has your father, saI'd the commander.
Do you think you can do anything for him?
Would your father want it to be done this
What an awful thing to do! shouted Henry.
Oh, would you teach us? cried the twins .
If you have been tricked, then so have I.
We should do something, suggested Goose .
How’s it going to get out? asked Sister .
If youre right there, why cant I see you?
Will these people sell you their things? 
He has one of his gorillas do it for him.
That’s right, said Alice, smiling at him.
Five people? asked Grandfather, smiling .
It’s all fixed up for light housekeeping.
Ho, I should say you didn’t! said Morris.
mighty proud if you were my boy, he says.
What do you mean by this particular vein?
The thing is, I want this done as soon as
That’s why I took the crackers, Mr. Smith
Would you like to see the childrens menu?
If you could stop bandying my name about.
If you dig there I will be ever so happy.
But I think that is just what he’s doing.
He’s tied up at the blue house, said Pat.
He’s not like the horses we used to have.
Yes, that’s all I did, said the Thin Man.
Believe me, you could, said Lars smiling.
Maybe there are other things in the cave.
The galloping greedy gimmies, added Papa.
His hand hovers over the mouse, as if hes
How dI'd you know I have a secret way in?
I’d like to start early tomorrow morning.
I see that it’s empty, said the Captain .
We are going home, too, Dave, said Henry.
What’s the matter? cried Henry, puzzled .
We can get Larry’s things dry in the sun.
I saw him working there when I went over.
How do you know it belonged to my mother?
I have been waiting for someone like you.
I’m going to use my new pen, said Violet.
How are we going to eat this? asked Mike.
Do you mind if I take them? asked Henry .
I suppose we must say goodby to the crew.
I should say so! Thanks for fixing it up.
A tin box sitting right in a wooden box! 
library if you want to know more, Jordan.
What time do you have dinner around here? 
He could get stuck in a wall or something.
Come now, we must go to bed, said Jessie .
Something must be buried here, said Henry.
Do you want me to locate this dwarf ornot?
But, tell me, why would you wish to defend
By the way, I bought something for supper.
Now do you remember who you are? asked Dr.
Now did we forget anything? asked Jessie .
THE MAYAK CHEMICAL TRAIN, MORTHERN RUSSIA 
Will Ireally be off the hook if I do this?
Where are you all going? Aunt Jane asked .
Stink, since when do you speak guinea pig?
What the heck is going on?! Stanley said .
Where do they shoot out of if hes unlucky?
May we have them? Please! Please! Please! 
Fine, said Henry, paying for the telegram.
Maybe I know it from my old fishing trips.
Don’t you worry any more, Joe, said Henry.
She’s just a baby dog, Watch, said Jessie.
Good for you, Violet, said Henry, smiling.
Do you know who that man is? Henry asked .
Yeah, but do you believe theyre good guys?
But we must get on with our fishing, Lars.
What’s in that big bag, Violet? he asked .
Do you have anything else metallic on you?
What’s the dead-man’s pedal? asked Benny .
Do you see those tall ferns? Lars pointed.
Do you mean a very green bay? asked Mike .
Can we see the things inside? asked Mike .
Look at his walk! It’s John Carter’s walk.
My great grandmother’s secret ingredient! 
My momll freak if I bring them home again.
Since when do you think you run the place?
I’m just going to see how big his room is.
I think he’s had just too much excitement.
I guess not, said David, smiling a little.
We’ll be more careful of her, said Jessie.
I do the washing, and Jessie hangs it out.
I didn’t even tell them where I was going.
We’ll have to carry food, and packs on our
Well, said Benny, it’s something Max said.
I think I can earn a good living this way.
That’s just where I am going, replied Joe.
I’m going to give you children this ranch.
I guess you are going to bark every night.
You’d better get going then, said the boy.
How is what going to get out? asked Mama .
It won’t be chowder, said Henry, smiling .
And even if she dI'd manage it, what then?
There’s no place to put candy on the boat.
How do you feel about it, Bill? asked Joe.
How could I have sold you to those madmen?
Just think of having a saucer! said Benny.
They found Bill’s rowboat a few dayslater.
I wouldn’t, Jessie, said Henry looking up.
I think that’s a wonderful name, said Mrs.
Its enough that I have to listen to Kamar.
I can add a line saying that the money you
And if I ever hear a word of this repeated
I have operations to get back to, Artemis.
if he were goading the doctor into action.
We must have help from some man who can do
We have to eat slowly this time, said Joe.
It’s in my pocket, and I can’t get it out.
Annie, Ill do anything if youll just play.
I hope it turns out to be worth exploring.
It’s lucky you do want to know everything.
I have to go right down there, said Benny.
I have to have my vegetables, said Benny .
Are we going to starve, Joe? asked Benny .
See this room going to waste! cried Benny.
Oho! So it’s your shell, Mike! said Henry.
I have been tying people up for centuries.
I have been living in the sun for so long.
You’ll have to smooth the cement and carry
I have been waiting for a long, long time.
That’s me, Flat Stanley! realized Stanley.
I tell them they can make something out of
I have a special assignment for you today.
We didn’t do anything to make this happen.
As long as I have you here, Im in control.
It’s such a hot day, she began pleasantly.
And what will we do if she doesnt recover?
We are going to put it on from the inside.
Only do come down! It’s a wonderful trick.
Of course, he may refuse to cooperate too.
There he goes, spouting water! said Henry.
Let’s get all blue things, then, said Mrs.
Let’s go home and get some bread and milk.
What do you think? teased his grandfather.
Let’s go down on the dock to wait for him.
If he spoke aloud, it could get confusing.
It looks like Abraham Lincoln’s log cabin.
He’s a smart boy all right, said Mr. Smith
Let’s eat supper at this littlerestaurant.
Hey, you know something? George announced.
He knows everything and he will settle it.
He is my cousin, the woman said, nodding .
That’s why we are going to see it come in.
Now, call him, said Rita, turning around .
Cook rubbed Larry’s hair with a hot towel.
But we have to find Speedy, Kevin argued .
What do you want to do now? asked the boy.
That must be those three men! Henry said .
That’s what you think! challenged Arthur .
That’s why we all know caboose Number 777.
Alden nodding his head at the storekeeper.
There’s about a million men, I should say.
Oh, Aunt Jane, he’s laughing! cried Benny.
That’s Old Flat Top, said Benny, pointing.
How can I believe you? asked the soldier .
If I get you candy, what will you give me?
How are we going on the trip? asked Benny.
You should see this crowd eat, said Larry.
That’s why I am so glad to see John Carter.
Right now you have to go to gym class, Mrs.
I know exactly where I can find a shingle! 
If I cannot defuse the bomb, then Holly can
Then he went on, We know nothing about him.
I like it deep, said Benny, swimming away .
It’s good to see nice young folks like you.
Would you be willing to get us some books? 
Its best if you have a torch if you godown.
would sure see him now if he tapped Webster
"Thank you all for coming," the mayor saId.
with my dad, as if her opinion isnt enough.
If I get what I want, then we all flourish.
We almost went over without a thing to eat.
Moore said he wanted more children to help.
Yes, I would, said Benny nodding his head .
Sadie blinks like she has dust in her eyes.
If you give the painting back to the world.
A pair of robins were feeding their babies.
I have waited so long to hear you say that.
Moore’s and stay, until the surprise comes.
Do you make your own candy? asked Mr. Smith
I thought the other cooking dishes would be
I think Watch hears something in the woods.
See how deep the pool is getting! he cried.
Alden, looking around at the smiling faces.
There must be lots of children in the town.
There must be some fish, Henry, said Benny.
I think it’s an exciting idea, said Violet.
There’s a man at the back door, said Benny.
It was a good day even if it was along day.
I thought nothing could happen to a Diesel.
Children forget things very soon, you know.
I thought I saw Mike’s writing! said Benny.
Can’t you stop him? Does he do that often? 
It can even scan your chest to see how fast
Did you want something, Captain? he asked .
Wait till you see your room at Aunt Jane’s.
And if she is not real, as you insist, then
Yes, they raced while my father was living.
It burns better when it’s old, said Benny .
Nevertheless, I have to control it, Butler.
Not quite, said Alice, smiling at the boy .
I think I’ll go to my neighbor’s, said Mrs.
Alden would be working for me, that’s sure.
It’s Aunt Jane! Violet whispered to Benny .
Some of this just needs cleaning, said Sim.
That’s exactly right, Lars! cried Mr. Smith
Jessie was mending it, and there they were.
But there is something mysterious about it.
She talked about shooting, y Bean said in a
That’s easy, sonny, said the man, laughing.
That’s because it’s on a hill, said Henry .
He was sitting with his head in his hands .
But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad.
We’re going faster than usual, said Jessie.
I’ve been wondering what that letter means,
I don’t mind waiting an hour, said Jessie .
He must have some place to hide his things.
Have you lost any more eggs? asked Maggie .
She’s going away at least, answered Jessie.
He began to take the things off the table .
But I guess we are going to be very hungry.
Now we’re really going home! shouted Benny.
She’s right over there, said Mike pointing.
Oh, Brother, would you like to come along? 
What’s the matter, Ben? asked Henry kindly.
Let’s eat lunch out on the rocks, she said.
Let’s use it for a stew kettle! said Mike .
He’s happy to do his job building the nest,
What’s the matter with you? shouted Freddy.
But of course we couldn’t bring any onions.
I am going to drink mine when it is cooler.
Joe has, said Benny to everyone’s surprise.
You may as well dance a jig for Arno Blunt.
But now it must be the middle of the night.
Oh, Grandfather, he’s bringing some toast! 
What do you mean? asked the lady, laughing.
How do you think we knew where to find you.
but it doesnt sound as if he believes this.
Why do you think the skeleton is a soldier?
you know about the magic I have in my fist.
What more can you tell us about the Oracle?
He is coming with my sister, said Mr. Smith
He is up in Violet’s room, answered Benny .
Oh, these three books must belong to a set.
Do you want to go home? Grandfather asked .
I have to go to bed in an hour because Mrs.
Do you think shes gone over the edge again?
Well, you made him out of my old stockings.
Okay, Dad, I have another question for you.
Now for Aunt Jane, said Violet, getting up.
I have seen stars before, but never sparks.
He has his own team and he can really play.
We must find a place to sleep, said Jessie.
Breakfast! called Cookie, ringing the bell.
Where have you been living? asked Mr. Smith
Now let’s get going or we’ll miss the bus! 
She hangs on him as if her weight will sway
Well, well! said Joe, sitting back to rest.
Maybe you could find something, said Lars .
Er—just some quilting business, said Mama .
You dont want to be there if it gets angry.
I have hundreds of hours on the simulators.
What doing? asked Larry, shutting his book.
I have no Idea how long well be underwater.
We will just have to find a place to sleep.
Because he’s a smart man, said Grandfather.
Something that would give him a good time? 
Rain is coming through the roof, said Henry.
Remember, we must have something to sleep in
OK, she saId, just what do you have in mind?
Of course, said Grandfather, smiling at her.
You know you may, said Jessie, smiling back.
And one more thing, I have decIded to wear a
She has a nasal voice, good for complaining.
You’re sending me to Mexico? Stanley gasped.
Captain Snow was getting plankton for Larry.
But when we land, you will all have to help.
Secret weapon? Are you kidding? Kevin asked.
Nothing is the matter with Joe, said Benny .
You can keep on knowing things all the time.
Oh, what are we going to have? asked Jessie.
You wouldnt keep secrets from me, would you?
because if you dont, I will be very unhappy.
You children are going to live in the barn! 
Now, boys, I am going to tell you something.
Oh, I’m crazy about old things, said Freddy.
You see the tide hasn’t been coming in long.
She looked from one smiling face to another.
Of course, said Violet, there’s the bedroom.
Alden, taking her small hand in his big one.
the most magical thing of all is Santa Bear.
mind if I stay here for the rest of my life.
Old Ben wants his lunch, he said, laughing .
And if youre worried about the boy, dont be.
Oh, butter! cried Jessie, her eyes shining .
She just liked beingthe center of attention.
You would have eaten poor old JW if I hadnt.
I’m going to open the door now, said Henry .
We’ll be driving up soon to see my new farm.
Well, said Benny, laughing, have you a cat? 
I have a collection of hunting rifles there.
Jessie, you can make anything! cried Henry .
Jimmy saI'd he may have swallowed something.
We’re going to find his parents, said Benny.
Jessie, look at that! cried Benny, pointing.
I have been looking for you for a long time.
That’s not an Indian name, said the ranger .
Well, I’m not going to sit here, said Benny.
I have chosen you to be my specialmessenger.
I have already disabled the Phonetix system.
I have a friend, replied the mystery caller.
I have been in this situation a dozen times.
That’s not a bad idea, Henry! cried Violet .
Hey! What are they thinking of? said Henry .
Let’s find stones and make five easy chairs.
What do you mean, not exactly? asked Benny .
Let’s explore the whole house, said Jessie .
He knew by Jessie’s voice that something had
He could see the girls walking around in the
That’s Henry’s very college, shouted Benny .
He was soaked and his hair was dripping wet.
I bet there’s a cellar under this woodshed! 
What are you going to do, Mike? asked Henry.
I can make dozens of things out of that wood
What about the little things? asked Jessie .
How can I imagine snow if Ive never felt it?
How are you going to do that? asked Sister .
Just in case theres a question I have missed
If I dI'd that, I might as well go and stand
Its the Mayak Chemical train, saI'd Artemis.
If Peter is here now, he must speak English.
If I go back, then I have already been back.
I was hoping somebodywould have a good idea.
I want to stop and see my friend Old Beaver.
I wonder if we will have any more adventures
I was just going to say that, said Mr. Smith
Ill tell you, but not if you harm my friend.
If you call him, then he has the upper hand.
Course I dont actually know if she can read.
If you were still a captain, youd know that.
There must be some reason, said Grandfather.
If he found us once, he could find us again.
Then we can have six more words, said Benny.
There are chairs on the deck and everything.
It’s the best way to cook corn, Al told her.
I have no Idea why my mother would say that.
I have no doubt that the moving dot is Opal.
I have no desire to be shoved back in again.
Well, I washed the doctor’s car, said Henry.
I have flown in worse conditions than these.
We won’t feel so strange here, knowing that.
It’s time, Goose, it’s time! Duck squawked .
I just wanted you to know what was going on.
We love to do things like that! said Jessie.
We could certainly go fishing, added Henry .
I like to have toads living under our steps.
It’s silver, just the same, said the doctor.
I have no real name, because I never warped.
I have put some thought into this, you know.
Where would you prefer to conduct our talks?
Down under the dock he has a big barrel full
When we get there, you must help me open the
Stop crying and I’ll build you a sand house.
Do you, Violet? Let’s all go into the woods.
Why should people want to hide? asked Benny.
Do youknow anybody in Nice who might oblige?
Going three in a canoe? I can fix you up all
Foaly, would you tell thepilot where I live.
What’s the matter with Spotty? yelled Mike .
When I have the lemur, I will crush you all.
When they chew it sounds like someone sawing
First thing is a shower for me, said Henry .
Somebody thinks he’s pretty smart, Mr. Smith
Mulch, I have an important question for you.
Do you think all of us ought to go, Jessie? 
Do you remember what happened to my brother?
Wouldn’t that be fun? Let’s try it sometime.
Here’s the key if you want to go in and look
Do you perhaps have a rifle in your cottage?
Whyever not? asked Mama, who was listening .
Miss Gray doesn’t ask questions for nothing.
Do you think this could be a natural cavern?
Moore, going over to the little housekeeper.
Do you think he wants to give a report to J.
Something funny here, Benny said to himself.
Gunpowder! said Aunt Jane with shining eyes.
I never heard of such a thing, said Mr. Smith
Trs cool if you were a single teen on the way
Onions! he shouted, running up to the kettle.
To think of running away from this kind man !
I know you are just dying to see that street.
I think it’s my birthday, too, said Mr. Smith
He gets two every day, so he must have a lot.
One shot, if you please, and avoI'd the head.
They raise hens, Benny, said Jessie smiling .
Do you know? asked Henry, in great surprise .
You are going to school as soon as it begins.
Do you know him? He’s nice and very friendly.
Those animals used to be walking around here.
And now all I have to show is a shining hand.
Nothing wrong with the house itself, I guess.
And now I have him back; were a family again.
With that, they all ran back to Jim’s Place .
What in the world is that thing? asked Benny.
He is taking it easy these days, said Maggie.
Grandfather finds lots of things, said Benny.
He has to pull each card before we get on the
He needs sleep more than food now, said Joe .
Nice in here, said Henry, looking around him.
What does he do for a living? asked Mr. Smith
I have made a few upgrades to the LEP system.
Let’s not talk about it any more, said Henry.
I have to give myself time to find the place.
We have been living in a boxcar in the woods.
It’s lucky we brought along Violet’s workbag.
followed if he hadnt held on to the headrest.
Oh, we’re having a neat time! answered Benny.
I have to admit it, Mud Boy, saI'd the dwarf.
I have sent Biff, thebear to the Great Field.
No, my Indian name is David Walking-by-Night.
Then can I have my dinner here? asked Benny .
No, just come, and forgive me for everything.
If you dont have the stomach for it, centaur.
The table drawer, said Henry, pulling it out.
If it fails, atleast we have time to regroup.
It isn’t much fun with two sharinga paintbox.
Do I get to yell Hardee-har-har if you flunk?
There are some men digging in your field now.
No, said Benny, walking over to his brother .
If you want to help, tell me the combination.
What do you want, Benny? Jessie called back .
The cherries must be picked, said the doctor.
Didn’t you have to go to school? asked Mike .
If you dont, I shall have to have him killed.
The neat thing is that she’s Peter’s mother! 
The next thing is to find Larry, said Jessie.
If I can find you this easily, they can, too.
If Grandfather is looking for us, it would be
If I go down, Master Artemis and Mrs Fowl are
If I go back in time and kill my grandfather,
They are glad Miss Alden is coming back here.
I wondered what would happenif I embraced it.
There’s the 1750 on the chimney, cried Benny.
I'd never bring my family on this island if I
If hed had a beard, he would have stroked it.
If he were, there would be a lot ofscreaming.
Yes, that’s what I say too, said Grandfather.
If hercondition worsens, call me immediately.
If I hadnt seen it, I would never have known.
Always something interesting on a canoe trip.
That’s what I don’t know, said the commander.
Do you ever regret taking up a life of crime?
Youll be lucky if you remember what color the
You should stay here and help Captain Daniel.
I expect I have enough here to get methrough.
Even my dad is nodding to Ness as if hes just
That’s a good way to put it, agreed Mr. Smith
I couldn’t tear myself away now for anything.
I’m sure this was Chi-Chi’s own hiding place.
I’m sure you folks can think of things to do.
I’m glad she is gone, remarked Benny, eating.
You dont think the beast is in there, do you?
Well, remember I grew up on Aunt Jane’s farm.
Well, said Benny, anyway, we’re not starving.
You see theygot Vitamin C without knowing it.
How can you insist on putting them in danger?
Thatcher asked, Jaaved, do you speak English?
What are you going to do, Willie? asked Sam .
Let’s take Peter’s dishes, too, said Jessie .
Here’s the fireplace with a back rock to keep
He will tell us if there is anything he wants
You surely want to take Mike’s turtle-kettle.
Shall I put the water on the fish now, Lars? 
What are you doing? Then she began to laugh .
I am going to fix up the house just the same.
You will see them put things in that big box.
You don’t have to worry about us, said Benny.
But why were you looking there? asked Violet.
What a wonderful thing to find! shouted Joe .
What about Mike’s writing, too? asked Benny .
But I have no Idea what will actually happen.
He stood beside me in the crowd, watching the
Don’t worry, said Jessie, getting up at once.
Maybe they are cooking up something or other.
Hey, what’s the matter with him? asked Henry.
What do you mean theres a message in the box?
Well, let’s go back to the ranch, said Henry.
Don’t you see? That’s why the fire started on
Here’s where we go fishing then, said Henry .
Shall we go to the store first? asked Henry .
I have driven some heaps in my time, Artemis.
Here, said Benny, handing the seaweed to Joe.
What’s the hardest part about taking a test? 
Thank you for carrying the bags, said Violet.
Maybe we could make a swimming pool, he said.
Because you must all come to supper sometime.
Oh, let’s watch Henry first, Benny answered .
Good boy! cried Captain Daniel, very pleased.
You said a storm was coming, and boy! here is
I have a lot morestraps in my camping things.
Where’s Pat? asked Mike, getting the cheese .
Tell me, what color are Joe’s eyes and hair? 
Let me go and get Watch, please! cried Benny.
He telephoned to us, said the boy, laughing .
What do you mean the White Mustang ismissing?
Yes, it’s called baseball stitch, said Jessie.
What do you like, if you don’t like the fish? 
You see they are going to blow the top off the
The cherry must be even better than the apple.
That’s where the canoe comes in? Benny asked .
The most important things are settled already.
The man must have poured gasoline on the fire.
Right, said Joe, smiling at his little cousin.
Then youcan use the paper for writing letters.
That’s what makes it so exciting, said Benny .
What do I have to do to get this Cube working?
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, said Jessie .
Well, my boy, I am going to surprise you, too.
What shall I do, Benny? asked his grandfather.
We shall have to be on the watch every minute.
We know there is something up in Maine anyway.
We know more than that, Uncle James, said Joe.
We might find something we want to bring home.
You’ll have to carry a lot of things with you.
You know, Jeff, I thought something was wrong.
She’s going to pay me by the week, said David.
What time shall we go swimming? asked Jessie .
You’ve got a long cut here, but it’s not deep.
That’s right, John, said Grandfather, nodding.
Well, because I have a sense that he shouldnt.
We should go talk to him, said Henry quietly .
Where are we going to move to? Brother asked .
Thank you, Mike, for showing us, said Violet .
This is one time I have to use what we’ve got.
You know, it’s okay to be afraid of something.
She rubbed her face, as if she were waking up.
There’s a paper inside the bottle, said Henry.
Yes, I’m Mike, and it’s my mother making pies.
Yes, I’m willing, and thankful, too, said Mrs.
We are going to stop at Old Village, said Joe.
WOW! A fish with fingers! exclaimed Sea Slug .
That will take many days, said Henry laughing.
Yes, your mystery is about y Bean, that’s why.
Well, well, you’re learning, Mike, said Henry.
We’ll never let Benny go to a Children’s Home.
That’s it, cried Henry, looking at his sister.
Its not as if I can go any higher on the list.
I didn’t see a single place where it might be.
Let’s race them down behind my old pink house.
But it’s true, Aunt Jane, said Jessie quietly.
He’s stealing eggs from the Beans, said Benny.
It’s a houseboat, I do believe! said Mr. Smith
I don’t think I’m going to bed, said Mr. Smith
It’s because there are no other lights at all.
Just grab and pull; dont worry if you tear it.
Hmmm, said the dentist, looking at the tooth .
Moose, do I have to explain everything to you?
Look at that boat, Lars, said Henry pointing .
He’s coming to visit us tomorrow, said Violet.
I have to talk to Piper and it wont take long.
DON’T YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUTCARING FOR EGGS? 
Just think! said Jessie, looking at the model.
I have unearthed an undiscovered species  as a
One shelf for spoons and things, said Jessie .
I begin to see, said Henry, looking at Morris.
I’ll come again early in the morning, said Dr.
Do you think it would scare her? Benny asked .
I want to watch! It’s a radio controlled job! 
Maybe I’d better tell you something, said Joe.
And if I say yes, youll believe me, I suppose.
Do you know what a sensation that will create?
I’m just going to give her something to drink.
But this brings it back, said Violet quietly .
Joe knows everything in the world, said Benny.
Maybe he does something else, too, said Benny.
It’s from Grandfather! Captain Daniel said so.
It’s heavy! I hope I don’t break the shingle! 
But seek where he may, he couldnot detect her.
Do you believe I could stand there all night? 
It’s such a lovely little house! cried Jessie.
Do you think that border is a little too busy?
Do you have a house? asked Benny in surprise .
Do you think theres a hot shower in this dump?
If you heal her, will she remember everything?
He would do anything his brother Sam told him.
Please, Jessie! Let’s have cookies for dinner.
He began to take the shingles out of his car .
If she had pups, she would have needed a mate.
Please let us go, Grandfather, Violet begged .
Has y Bean been living here in this woodshed? 
If you just let yourselves go, who knows where
But I am sure if I made a call they would make
I learned that before you got through talking.
"Do youwant to take one home with you, George?
I have promised your mother that the Fowls are
Let’s try it anyway, Grandfather, said Jessie.
He must be selling Maggie some more asparagus.
"Would you like something to eat, too, George?
He sighs as if Im a sorry specimen of mankind.
Benny did that one day with Violet’s scissors.
No, I didn’t hear a word, said Henry, smiling.
Charley Jackson, said the boy, running faster.
Now don’t you go teaching me, Ben! said Mike .
I have no Idea beyond this, but I dont want my
Here’s a little book and a pen, said Mr. Smith
If he tried to resist the water, it would slap
Are you going to stay very long? asked Marie .
Coffee? asked Violet, looking at Grandfather .
Are we going out West to see Aunt Jane again? 
Henry, let’s teach school! Even I could teach.
A shell-pile means that Indians must have been
I can’t imagine having a hamster running loose
All I have to do is put humans in contact with
Please come and sit in our car, begged Violet.
If it was easy, I'd do it myself, saI'd Carla.
Let’s go and ask her, Grandfather, said Benny.
Nothing was saved except clothing and bedding.
Let’s study that painting of George Washington.
I think it is, too, otherwise I should not have
That sounds right to me, said Henry, laughing .
I thought I could carry things up the mountain.
We’re trying to find a policeman, Jessie said .
Those four always find such interesting things.
Let’s go to the doll museum first, said Jessie.
But for the whole country, stones could be more
You see I never had a chance formuch schooling.
I don’t want to hear any more talking about it.
Morse’s son who can fix the roof? asked Benny .
Watch is right here, looking at me, said Henry.
Mr Raja wondered if he was doing it on purpose.
We are having a little trouble with the engine.
But Henrydid not stop to say how pretty it was.
Bill’s getting too tired, answered Joe quietly.
You would be a big help, said Jessie, smiling .
You would ask that, Benny, said Henry laughing.
But I found something under the woodshed that I
I sure would be mad at you if you sent me away.
Mattaman will have my head if I leave her here.
But there was old Rufe Grizzly’s General Store.
But why is Larry using seaweed? asked Mr. Smith
I don’t like children, but we must try a little
We’ll do that right off, said Henry getting up.
Mike is packing his red suitcase this very day.
I don’t think he is going to give up like that.
Well, what’s the matter with him? asked Henry .
Maybe he’s a friend of Miss Gray’s, said Henry.
But shenever wore it when she was doing tricks.
I suppose I should have gone back, said Henry .
There’s a grouper in the pool now, said Violet.
Everyone will see Freddy Willet if he’s around.
Where did these things come from? asked Henry .
When I came down the stairs, he stopped talking
Here’s one of the best camping places in Maine.
Hes clearly waiting to hear what I have to say.
That’s the last thing I thought of, said Henry.
Its just that I have a thing about giant squId.
His voice sounded just like his grandfather’s .
If I give you this watch, maybe you can tell me
He’s not my Mystery Man, said Jessie, laughing.
If I get caught, will this happen to my father?
He doesn’t tell me much, but I know he’s trying
He seemed to be having trouble with his words .
Have you seen that little white building on one
He saId, What do you mean, theyre not gorillas?
I have recently been introduced to parachuting!
Then we’ll doFarmer Ben’s and our sitter’s—Mrs.
If it hadnt been for Holly, we never would have
Girls, I can’t do a thing with your aunt today.
For my information, how much money do you make?
What do you see him doing, Henry? asked Benny .
Good, said Henry, looking at the bunch of line.
The first thing you need for a club is members.
I was afraid of Jane, said y, speaking quietly.
Do you have a theory on what the Star could be?
They’re a good dessert, and there’s no cooking.
Do you have any hot waffle to draw the missiles
That’s exactly right, my boy, said Grandfather.
What bright red and yellow on his black wings! 
Carter says this place won’t be quiet any more.
Yes, we’ll bring it to Violet, agreed Mr. Smith
Let’s go the minute lunch is over, said Benny .
That’s a queer kind of a present, said Violet .
Did you work for y Bean’s father? asked Benny .
Dad will kill you if you have another accIdent.
It’s only me, Mama, he said, showing his face .
Ian wondered if hed be asked to go along again.
It’s wonderful to have someone nice to talk to.
It’s both, said Henry, who could see the trail.
Ho! What are you crying about, Ben? asked Mike.
Why dont you see if you can turn round in time.
Write everydayeven if its only for ten minutes.
I went for a few weeks and then I’d go hunting.
Do you know that the boy in the red cap is Mrs.
I’ll take that now, said the Captain, laughing.
Do you know where they’re fixing the driveway? 
I have no doubt that Commander Kelp will want a
I never lost you, said John Carter, getting up.
I have good carpets, he saI'd in broken French.
Well, if I chew his down a bit, I might makeit.
People should have what they want on birthdays.
Pond is certainly early, said Jessie, laughing.
now Grandfather’s going to cry, thought Benny .
A big room going to waste, Jessie! said Benny .
Right now we are looking for some place to eat.
Oh, said Benny, of course, you should go first.
Then something happened like a smallearthquake.
I just told you, and that’s all the time I had.
Well, I don’t care at all, said Mike’s mother .
Because he is doing the same work that you are.
few of the mines I have planted in the grounds.
look, Joe! Look at the arrowhead sticking out! 
She was always telling us about bananas growing
We know it has something to do with Bear Trail.
We have to go home tonight, said Jessie sadly .
And, once I have the lemur, I will be immortal.
the truth here, son, if you keep it between us.
She has been through one entire shelf this way.
I have always liked your style, Doctor Kronski.
And if its broadcasting, the Cube can trace it.
Aren’t we going to cook my clams? asked Benny .
I have a feeling well have a lot to talk about.
A good thing you stopped me, because that stuff
Oh, you’d laugh! It was a string of old buttons.
Oh, Grandfather, what shall we do? said Violet .
Let’s go for a walk in the woods this afternoon.
Does the secret have anything to do with music? 
All the trouble he’s made! Running away and all.
You all need food, Al said, going up the ladder.
Yes, you are right, good thinking, agreed Duck .
Whose number are you going to call? asked Benny.
There! she said, washing the last shining spoon.
Aren’t you going to read the book? said Sister .
Scout shrugs as if he doesnt even remember this.
Let’s make see on one paper and me on the other.
Where did that gun come from? Well, that’s easy.
What do you really think of Captain Holly Short?
Why do you believe everything Darby Trixle says?
You folks would always think up something to do.
I don’t like to have people hiding and listening
Each one of us can carry some things downstairs.
Can’t we go into the big building? asked Benny .
Er, that’s right, said Sister, a school project.
Let’s go out and see the lighthouse, said Benny.
Who in the world is that with him? It’s a girl! 
That is just what I was thinking, said Mr. Smith
Or La Abuela’s secret would be a secret no more.
It certainly is, answered Joe, feeding the fire.
I can’t, answered Jessie, giving back the paper.
Would you like me to help you pick up your toys?
Why, it got so bad we couldn’t go there anymore.
They look fine coming in one by one, said Benny.
Do you see what I see, Captain Henry? he asked .
I would rather count in fives, if you dont mind.
Why must you? But it was the last word he spoke.
nonscientific speech I have ever heard you make.
I’m going to take a shower the first thing I do.
She has changed, and now she’s really wonderful.
I’ll be the one to tell you where the things go.
Oh, let’s look at it, Grandfather, said Jessie .
Why—it’s a moose! He’s swimming across the lake.
She’d shoot him, said Willie, nodding his head .
I would like that best of anything in the world.
I’ll tell him it’s the folks from the houseboat.
Would you have agreed if I had told you earlier?
I’ll help you pull out the stuffing, said Benny.
I hope it will hold milk, said Jessie, laughing.
That’s the housekeeper in you, Jess, said Henry.
I bet it’s the man to fix the roof, said Benny .
Put them in here, said Papa, handing him a box .
Do you understand what I am saying to you, Runt?
Oh, the same old thing, about feeding the world.
Oh, Henry, do you think you could? cried Violet.
That’s a big basket you have, said Jessie to Dr.
Cube, can you disable the Phonetix alarm system?
Why do you say that, young fellow? asked Henry .
Oh, can I keep that kind of things? cried Mike .
I am going to win this race! he said to himself.
It’s coming in all over the place, cried Henry .
Do you know what Bear Trail means? asked Benny .
I am going to step on it and see what I can see.
She has to warm up her arm, buddy, Scout shouts.
Joe’s father and your grandfather were brothers.
And if you are dead, then the principal is dead.
There’s plenty of seaweed here, too, Benny said.
Well, you can, said Joe after thinking a minute.
What’s dangerous about it? she asked, wide-eyed.
We can start from the statue’s nose, said Benny.
Milo, if you will, just nudge that rock forward.
Someone must have telephoned the police station.
Something is obviously bothering the little guy.
I suppose you could keep one thing, if you must.
Going on a canoe trip? These all your children? 
Now, Benny, said Henry, stop talking about food.
I have no doubt he already knows, saI'd Artemis.
Well, said Mama, I think we can work things out.
Here’s a big white cup, too, she said, happily .
So they won’t float away, said Benny, watching .
No, it’s a float, said Captain Daniel, laughing.
Then you have to walk about a quarter of a mile.
He knows about things like that, Aunt Jane says.
But where’s the money, and where’s the tin box? 
We must make those spoons very soon, said Henry.
You’ll just have to believe it, Sam, said Henry.
What will happen to Mike’s family? asked Henry .
I guess you are the people traveling by caboose.
He doesn’t like to see us do anything dangerous.
He couldnt tell any tales, even if he wanted to.
But we ought to have something good to dig with.
Look! said Sister as they were leaving the mall.
There must be some good Indian digging in there.
Ive already started, would you like to know how?
It’s funny, said Jessie, that Watch doesn’t bark.
That’s enough nevers, Ben, said Henry looking up.
My father’s name is Peter Horn, too, said Peter .
Jane can’t wait a minute when she wants anything.
Oh, can’t we go fishing today, Joe? asked Benny .
We are going to get a lot of dishes, said Jessie.
He took Violet’s arm as they went into the store.
I’ve always needed something to punch holes with.
There’s the Elm Tree Inn, Violet said, pointing .
Alden, taking the children to the window to look.
Now, here’s one that looks fine on the outside  …
What would we ever do without you? Let’s see what
That’s fine! said Jessie, as if he had said ‘Yes.
And, as usual, you need me to do your dirty work.
Didn’t your sister’s daughter have any children? 
But we must pick out the bowls and dishes, first.
Wait, wait! Here’s another one! George announced.
Just so it’s got nothing to do with Father’s Day.
I’m not going to tell you, said Henry, laughing .
If you know something it is your duty to tell me.
He began to put more blueberries into his mouth .
You’ll have to use my bed for him, said Mr. Smith
We all feel that something is wrong, said Henry .
Watch was already in the tunnel, smelling around,
There! said Jessie, stepping back to look at it .
That dime has sat here for more than sixty years.
Haven’t you ever heard of shivering from fright? 
phone Miss Frazetti if you cant control yourself.
It’s so hard to tell you about our brother Benny.
He jumped up and said, More coffee, Grandfather? 
I wonder if hes up there now, looking down on us.
We’ll drink more milk than that, Sim, said Henry.
Youre a good person even if you dont know it yet.
I’ll put the cement on Violet’s feet, said Henry.
Talking to strangers! It’s just not a good idea! 
It’s very faint, but it stays right in one place.
it looks as if there are several buildings there.
Oh, let’s go up and see the Indians, said Jessie.
And if I accept that I am alive, then I should be
Oh, everything is happening at once! cried Benny.
He puts Uncle Bob’s money in the bank every week.
I'd drop down to five hundred feet if I were you.
I have so much to show you, he babbled excitedly.
How can you be so blind to the truth, donkey boy?
No, Fowl, if it reeks of anyone, it reeks of you.
However, if you might help me offwith this sling?
You have paid for it already, said Rita, smiling.
Do you know what the word respect actually means?
He has reconsIdered, saI'd Thatcher with a smirk.
But Diggums can help if he wants; its his choice.
Do you see what I see? That dirt has been moved! 
So if you paint a kitchen, then you get a tattoo?
No, I mean the black ring on the man’s left hand.
Not a nice way to go, even if you were fireproof.
I’m going down to the beach to watch those boats.
we’re going to this island? asked Violet softly .
All I want is to get Carlos’s great grandmother’s
If you pushed or shoved, youhad to beat two rugs.
If you want to stay alive, you need to stayalert.
But now I have decIded that you are worthy of it.
Who says he’s done something wrong? asked Benny .
Chi-Chi always hid it when she wasn’t wearing it.
Well, yes, my dear, said Bill, almost whispering.
You must show us how to climb trees, said Henry .
I have another chance, and I will not waste it on
We don’t know much more than we did, said Jessie.
Do you want your eyeballs to dry up and fall out?
Obviously they were still aboard the Mayak train.
The back was pushed down and closed up that hole.
Where do you get your Ideas and inspiration from?
Alden, taking a small blue book from his pocket .
Just exactly like it! said Henry, looking at it .
We’ll dive for it, said Jessie, swimming faster .
Well, it certainly is strange looking, said Mama.
Maybe he would, old fellow, said Henry, laughing.
Of course I don’t know anything about old things.
Because I like beans better, said Lars, smiling .
The children found some more pieces and gave them
Alden, and I should like to take you all with me.
You must stay to dinner, he said to the children.
Do you want to have that chest infection forever?
I should think somebody would have spoken to him.
He’s taking care of my sister Violet, said Benny.
What do you think of this pie business, Mr. Smith
Sh, Violet! Come! We are going to run away again.
I think it is a school bell, said Henry laughing.
Let me show you what else we are doing, Mr. Smith
If you open the throttle, you might just make the
I have not finished with you yet, Mulch Diggums  
Let’s go down to the kitchen, then, said Jessie .
Do you want to run in the race? a man asked him .
Egghead here goes on forever if you dont stop her.
It’s fun to run, anyway, he said again to himself.
Eat anything you see, said Larry, almost smiling .
Where could they go? he cried, getting up quickly.
We must certainly show him the museum, said Henry.
What do you mean? asked Violet, laughing a little.
It wasnt as if shecould get into any more trouble.
Its almost as if hes actually manipulating a tool.
It’s right over the first one, Violet, said Benny.
Don’t we have to take a bag if we stay overnight? 
That’s why she lives all alone and never goes out.
ps that probably made sense if you were a centaur.
I hope he will talk more than Willie, said Benny .
Its not as if you have to fasten the cuffs, is it?
There’s a spring up there, and quite a good place.
Rain is coming in my window, too, and all over me.
If I do have a moment to myself, I do enjoy a good
If I were you, I'd concentrate on the job in hand.
If I were stuck in a diabolical trap, I would want
Hmm, said Brother, thinking about it for a moment.
The PI mayhave been devious, but he was no killer.
The only thing I can say is that if I were you, Id
He’d do anything for his friends, said his mother.
If you shoot them, theyll just get bigger and more
Shaw’s face, and the Thin Man’s face, said Benny .
That’s where we’ll find Bill, said Benny happily .
We have your favorite things, Miss Jane, she said.
Oh, make him say something about me! begged Mike .
When I was coming down, the first step broke away.
There’s your suit, Jessie, if it fits, said Henry.
His mother usually seemed more concerned about his
that’s where we will take you, said Captain Brown.
It’s about the cave and the shell-pile, said Joe .
When my grandfather really gets going, Sim, things
Do you think we havent thought about this, MudBoy?
That’s what I say too, said Henry softly to Benny.
Get up and look what’s coming, boys, called Alice.
There’s somebody in the water, too! cried Morris .
Don’t feel bad about falling, Charley called back.
He has come among us as a wolf in sheeps clothing.
Why dont I have a poke around in your in my study.
A sewing basket for you, she said, made with love.
He has received aninfusion of life, body and mind.
He’s looking for trouble, that feller! said Benny.
As you know,he has a knack for finding rats, and .
We found the things and you could tell about them.
Now how shall we put it in the log? asked Violet .
I have everything for a canoe trip, said Mr. Smith
I can’t tell you that, said Sim, shaking his head.
Mike is getting to be a very nice, thoughtful boy.
Yes, it is softer and it stretches more, Mr. Smith
Can’t you say anything but ‘yep’? Maggie laughed .
Do you have any Idea what I had to do to get here?
Supposing we had never asked to go into the little
Oh, can I watch you? Do you mind? asked the girl .
What are you thinking about, old man? asked Henry.
That’s because we worked so hard, remarked Jessie.
I have almost eight years experience in the art of
I am very much pleased with you, said Grandfather.
I suppose I shall have to show it to you, said Dr.
foot connecting with your behind if you slow down.
Land and I may not return to the manor when I have
Soon the train won’t stop at Centerville any more.
Yes, that’s where we got our cement, said Jessie .
You may have noticed that my project is in crisis.
She’s good, isn’t she? asked Joe, turning around .
That was no strike! screamed Mama, waving her hat.
Sometimes I feel bad about the things I have done.
I can’t see anything wrong downstairs, said Henry.
You must remember that once upon a time she really
I bet some day he’s going to find out, said Benny.
You’re not going to live up at the mine, are you? 
Just traveling in a caboose is good enough for me.
Calm and sensible, eh? she said, looking at Papa .
Well, it’s the old family ranch, said Grandfather.
I think we should remain calm, Goose yelled back .
You dont know much about being a fugitive, do you?
But you must cart stones in it when I get it done.
You don’t call Joe company, do you? asked Violet .
But you never made a pie, said Henry, looking up .
But, Papa, called Small Bear, following after him.
I shall miss the barking and noise in the morning.
Do you mean we can really go today? asked Jessie .
We’ll have to solve the mystery, Ben, said Henry .
I feel like I have been lying on racks for a year.
We’ll look very carefully and tell you everything.
I feel just like starting out again, said Jessie .
But even if your father were to return, what then?
Do you see how he keeps looking over his shoulder?
My grandfather told me fishing takes lots of time.
I’ve been trying to think what my grandfather will
I’ve got a young friend staying with me in my hut.
Wouldn’t we save time by asking Jim? asked Henry .
Well, the books aren’t interesting, said Mr. Smith
But I’ll say something if I want to, argued Mike .
I don’t feel like playing with you today, she said.
In the meantime, may I ask if youve had any others?
We’ll be back soon, he said, pulling in the steps .
In three months, I have already grown half an inch.
For now you must trust the advice I have given you.
She’s a tiny little thing, but I was afraid of her.
this time let’s get a real fire going and not be in
Secret ingredient? Stanley’s mother leaned forward.
You’ve got to get going, Katie’s mother warned her.
The door must be locked and the windows don’t open.
Now, let’s see how this was, Henry said, excitedly.
When are we going to move? Brother wanted to know .
If you were,we would have picked up your broadcast.
What’s the name of this village? asked Grandfather.
But that boy is too young to be smoking cigarettes.
You would never have come here if I'd suggested it.
Bedrooms! cried Benny, pointing to the box stalls .
Then Larry is well if he is talking sense, said Dr.
But I can assure you she’s a perfectly nice person.
I shall talk so much you’ll be tired of hearing me.
But he still doesn’t know what he is talking about.
Haven’t I told you, ‘No horsing around?!’ Mr. Smith
He did not know that he was standing in melted ice.
You will have to put your mouth right in the water.
He is having too much excitement after forty years.
No, shouted Benny, it’s our company! It’s Mr. Smith
Then we could live, even if we didn’t have anything
Thanks, Katie replied, sitting down next to George.
We are not going to make a fuss about Father’s Day.
What do you want to see, Benny? Grandfather asked .
Not a very good day for fishing, Henry, said Benny.
You’d be slow too, if you’d been running all night.
I found one! It’s all bumpy and has a funny shape! 
Hello? Stanley called, leaning through the archway.
There is a little spring over there, said Mr. Smith
If its any consolation, she wont suffer at the end.
Violet needs a good night’s sleep after that scare.
But let’s make our own beds with our blanket rolls.
She’s got a funny voice when she sings, said Mike .
I have no Idea why shes bringing her baseball gear.
The goblin was right, even if he dIdnt realize why.
Henry, I was sure you heard us, said Joe, laughing.
You’ll have to wear some of my clothes, said Henry.
We saw that under the microscope going to Blue Bay.
Somebody’s coming! shouted Mike from the open door.
What would you tell meif you lay dying, old friend.
But how does it fit in with cooking smells and your
I have no research, no calculations and no subject.
Maybe you can be the bell ringer later, said Benny.
We can get into it and stay until it stops raining.
Now what do you think those are for? asked Violet .
Oh, John Hancock’s men got all the guns they could.
Its too close to the sun and I have sensitive skin.
I have less than eight hours to clean up this mess.
Did something happen a long time ago? asked Henry .
I have waited two years for Julius to send a major.
Do you feel better now, Captain? asked the doctor .
It’s because I’m so glad to have a good microscope.
Oh, wait! called Jessie, running down to the dock .
And you can be teacher if you want to, saI'd Lizzy.
Let me bring the block from my woodpile, said Joe .
Ciaran nodded solemnly, as if hed proven his point.
Lambchop said, smiling, guess what’s for breakfast.
I want to see the top floor with the porch railing.
Lets go say hello, I say as if I do this every day.
We don’t make any more pies, that’s sure, said Mrs.
Just step down to the store, said Henry, laughing .
Anyway, we blasted and that’s more than I expected.
Just what I planned, said Grandfather, getting up .
It’s tied down near the road, when there is a road.
How do you know so much about smelly stuff, anyway?
How do you know so much about Ashland? asked Henry.
I’ll find a way to let you know if I hear anything.
That’s one of Santa’s many helpers, explained Papa.
Do you think any of those men hid in our woodshed? 
We’re all going for brunch at the Grizzmore Grille.
Do you think its my faultIsabella is dead, my lady?
How do you know he is the same dog? asked Mr. Smith
How much is the necklace worth? asked Grandfather .
Do you think we could still beat my younger self to
We have to buy a sink and a refrigerator, Mr. Smith
I was going to get a lot of blueberries for supper.
I’ll never get out of here if I don’t stop thinking
Do you suppose it’s your Mystery Man? asked Benny .
Well, I guess I am sure, said Joe, turning it over.
It’s our own mine after all, and we haven’t seen it
That’s what Jessie thought, Aunt Jane, said Violet.
I thought you didn’t like it, said Henry laughing .
cracking a lobster with a hammer as if he hated it.
It must be fun to cook and eat on a boat like that.
Everybody is talking about your trip and how it was
You bring in some big stones and some dry wood, and
He’ll be all right, said Joe, looking back at Bill.
Can you really hear people taking a crap and stuff?
This is not your yard and just who do youbelong to?
I thought something was queer about him, cried Jim.
We would like it better than anything in the world.
There’s a mouse in my shoe! He leaped up ona bench.
If I were you, I'd give Justin Barre a call over at
Wed all be smashed in if I had to shut thetop door.
I want three loaves of bread, please, said Jessie .
I can see why people enjoy working for Grandfather.
David is going to be even busier, said Grandfather.
I can go back to my house this morning, said Larry.
Do you think he’ll be at the station? asked Henry .
I have only a preliminary report, Monsieur Paradizo.
I really think you two girls might do Jane more good
How do you think of everything, Violet? said Jessie.
I guess we’re going nowhere in a hurry, said Benny .
If she reacts adversely, then well drop the subject.
What do you have to do to be a professional smeller?
He stays out in the field all the time eating grass.
I thought they were working on a big school project.
If he is alive, she thought, but dI'd not broadcast.
How did you know we were coming today? asked Benny .
This school idea is a surprise to me, but it’s fine.
What do you know! cried Henry, looking at the birds.
Well, we can’t do anything about it now, said Benny.
What do you know about your delivery to Delphi Keep?
I could go on and on riding in this caboose forever.
How close do you have to be to see this isnt my dad?
If he dId,he might as well hand over the leadership.
I have barely enough left to shield on the way home.
He’s looking for the bone he buried, laughed Benny .
If I dIdnt know better, I'd think you were ina MOOD.
He’s got a new station wagon! He ran down the steps.
Too bad we have to use this for a kettle, said Lars.
What do you say to someone whosemother is that sick?
We want to know just how you do things, said Jessie.
There’s no place to eat in Port Elizabeth, and you’d
I am going to ask your grandfather if he will come! 
We do the very same thing; we must be just like you.
If its not goblin gangs, its time-travelling demons.
I want to show you something, Carter, said Mr. Smith
Think about what will happen if you do turn yourself
I always hope to find something important in a cave.
We could go up to the farm and get everything ready.
What do you really think of Artemis Fowl and Butler?
He took hold of Joe’s hand and tried to pull him up.
I will bring the kitchen table in here, said Henry .
Hello, Aunt Jane, said Benny, going over to the bed.
If hes anything like the vIdeos you showed me of the
Hold it! cried Captain De Rosa, jumping to his feet.
If she couldnt stun Butler, she would mesmerize him.
Today you must build something for me out of stones.
He was looking down over the railing into the water.
But mysister saI'd  What kind of stuff do you smell?
But I thought they wouldn’t believe anything I said.
You may refer to me as Miss Koboi, for the next five
So he hasn’t really stolen a thing, finished Benny .
Because if you dont, I may go back insIde the house.
Next thing old Myna will say, ‘Look out, it’s hot!’ 
It’s an island at high tide with water on all sides.
But these woods are not as interesting as the ranch.
Look at that great big shell sticking up, said Mike.
Maybe he has another cave, I thought with a shudder.
Stay here forever if you want, Im going up the pipe.
Do you want a lot of dry sticks, Lars? asked Henry .
When we were up at the mine, I remembered something.
She saI'd she has a pedicure booked for the morning.
Everyone likes Ma’s pies and everyone will buy them.
If youve harmed one tip of my officers pointy ears .
Are you going to burn them up, Jessie? asked Benny .
Are you going to the stores now, Joe? asked Jessie .
It is ‘Good morning’ I should think, replied Jessie.
Now would you mind getting that beam out of my face.
You’re a big boy, and you ought to be up helping us.
Now, don’t let’s get upset, said Joe’s strong voice.
Is this picnic going to be lunch or supper, Violet? 
Let’s go back to the woodshed and take a flashlight.
Wow! said Sister, looking into Brother Bear’s mouth.
I’m sure Al will tell us if there is anything wrong.
Do you know what you just said? Maybe that cellar is
I’m going to have roast beef and mashed potatoes and
That year I was going to take you up in the Rockies.
Yes, said Captain Daniel, taking in the lobster pot.
Katie’s stinking up the classroom! George exclaimed.
Do you have a response to this outrageous statement?
Yes, we really do, said Joe, after looking at Alice.
Come over some day to see me, and tell me some more.
Will the wedding be in our house too? asked Jessie .
But you will rest a long time before doing any work.
Wondering if he had beenmanipulating them magically.
You found it, and you found the Indian things in it.
Tattling is telling just to be mean, explained Mama.
Why would you be making a chess set out of it, then?
That must have been a long time ago, for it’s an old
That’s just what I wanted to know, said Grandfather.
Do you really think such an advanced race will leave
Let’s guess, said Violet, taking Alice’s other hand.
That means I’ll have to wait till last, said Benny .
All the things will go in a museum bigger than Uncle
Hall will have something for her bites, said Jessie.
Almost as bright as day, said Benny, looking around.
The rain is coming in somewhere, said Jessie softly.
See her ears now? She knows we’re talking about her.
Oh, look at that big fish swimming in! cried Benny .
What’s the matter with the horses now? asked Benny .
now the next thing is to get these pictures printed.
Always doing something new! We didn’t know you could
Oh, that’s going to be a pitcher, whispered Jessie .
Then he must be the man that said you set the fire! 
Then she almost bumped into a boy about Benny’s age.
Pond at last, we might sit here all day for nothing.
Why do you think Watch is a help, Sam? asked Benny .
you can say it’s from the Boxcar Children, and Alice
If you do hear anything about this man, send someone
What? shouted Henry, almost falling down the steps .
A little kI'd I have here by the scruff of the neck.
He did take you fishing once, didn’t he? said Henry.
And if you cant forgive her, well, shame on you too.
And she has a hot pad on the top for the tent cover.
The Number One cocktail if you like, which makes you
For heavens sake, Julius, how much more do you need?
And, if I were you, I'd stick close to the bighuman.
Camping is the thing we like to do best in the world.
I have no Idea what you mean, saI'd Holly innocently.
He may do something to the mine if we don’t stop him.
We went exploring, said Violet, and found a big dump.
Joe! Wait! I hear something, called Jessie suddenly .
She thought she knew what it could be, and if she was
Piper asks innocently, as if I were the one refusing.
That Joe is a very interesting man, replied Mr. Smith
We’re going to have ham and eggs, too, said Mr. Smith
there’s the mystery all solved, said Alice laughing .
I do not care, he said, sticking his nose in the air.
Perhaps we can find out if she has a villa near here.
This time he couldn’t help it, said Benny, laughing .
Let’s make places for cups on the table, said Violet.
I have been looking for you children for a long time.
I have only seven and a half fingers, not thetheatre.
She said something in Spanish and then turned back to
A good question, Henry, said Aunt Jane, much pleased.
Pull our canoe out of Joe’s way, so he can land, too.
I know what I will see, but I have no wish to see it.
"Would you like a treat for your performance, George?
Check it out, everybody! There’s a Mud Monster in the
Just keep thinking how lonesome Grandfather has been.
STOP YELLING! Duck yelled, then whispered forcefully.
I can’t think of anything I’d rather do! said Jessie.
Let’s go out and sit on the front steps, said Jessie.
She has taken all of her buttons out and shes putting
This entire situation could be wrapped up if it wasnt
That will give us lots of things to do on rainy days.
I don’t think we’ll find any more clues in this room.
I don’t think so, said Benny, to everyone’s surprise.
I guess you’re not used to running in the deep woods.
Well, well! said Henry at last, looking up at a tree.
Maybe your sharp young eyes will see something my old
Something terrible must have happened to Grandfather.
she rushed out of the door, leaving the girls alone .
But if she dIdnt fly it, then her comrades were dead.
Sister Bear knew exactly who Mama was talking about .
I said Joe is going to live with us, and he’s my best
Tie the strings together and hang them over the line.
I hope I can have some more wedding cake, said Benny.
No, we have to heat water from the well, said a man .
Now the next thing is to tell Aunt Jane, said Jessie.
Smoothly, as if hes done this a hundred times before,
You’ll have to pay me back what I paid, said Freddy .
I don’t really mind going to bed tonight, said Benny.
Well, let’s look for someone to help us, Jessie said.
You know lots of things, don’t you, Joe? said Benny .
Or if you were too busy cooking, we could swim before
We haven’t time to look around any more, said Jessie.
And if I decIde to do this, how will I get the roses?
She has murdered her commander, allied herself with a
Let’s save all the flowers we find, too, said Jessie.
Well, sir, these children are fishing, said Mr. Smith
Ollie a call, see if he has a minute to look at this.
Soon the men were eating great plates of quick bread.
Now what does that mean—Ho-hum? asked Joe, laughing .
I have a feeling the newspaper people heard about the
As you know, your mama is going to have another baby.
them the other, as if he cant find plumb on his nose.
Do you want to work every day?’  he said he had never
It will be much more fun if Joe and Alice go with us.
If you even think a troll is near, run like the wind.
Do you want me to stay outside and watch? asked Sam .
Why do you think hes trying so hard to learn to play?
If I had a sister, Im sure she would be inconsolable.
He was beginning to want to live in the boxcar, too .
Does that have to do with babies, too? asked Sister .
If she gets her hands on Jayjay, shell be invincible.
What shall we do? Where shall we go? thought Jessie .
It’s not our teacher! It doesn’t look a bit like her.
Do you think your parents were saved? asked Mr. Smith
Do you think she was talking abouther Delphi or ours?
That’s right, and for anything else you want to wash.
That’s sure! But she gave us everything we asked for.
It’s Grandfather, Violet!  he isn’t cross after all! 
It’s bigger than Port Elizabeth, though, Jessie said.
It’s an American button, and it has four holes in it.
When are you going to try, Grandfather? asked Benny .
Hey, mister, is it OK if I bring my invisible friend?
Hetook off a chain to make an opening in the railing.
If you want to go swimming, just jump out the window.
Everybody says that I have no sense of humour, then I
If it bleeds, we can kill it, saI'd the earl gravely.
Freddy is hiding, that’s sure, said Benny to himself.
If youd like to wait here, Ill fetch the boys foryou.
What’s the matter? asked Henry, coming down the hall.
He’s a very handy man, Joe is, put in Captain Daniel.
Each stall had a largewindow and nothing else at all.
Eight arms, if I remember correctly, thought Artemis.
It must have been built in Colonial days, said Henry.
He wouldn’t even let us dig any more inside the cave.
The man said we must eat just half of our lunch here.
If you want anything in the night, you can come down.
If you two cant handle it, Ill bring in another team.
Every few months, I have to take the ten-bottle test.
They walked straight to the piles of cooking dishes .
What does it taste like, Ben? asked Henry, laughing .
That’s exactly what I do like best, really! he cried.
Do you think Peter has been here, or is he here now? 
How many places will you need to put things, Jessie? 
I am here for the secret ingredient of Isabela Beluga
I was thinking about Sam’s horse, Dolly, said Henry .
I think your turtle must have died, Mike, said Henry.
I’m going to teach this baby bird to swim, Duck said .
I have quite a consIderable force at my disposal here.
Now lookee here, what if I took off some of that blue.
I never heard of such a thing—traveling on a caboose! 
Do you know when your brother is coming? Henry asked .
I have a feeling that the government is monitoring me.
I can reach the gantry if you give me a little height.
If I took you down Broadway Warden Williams would give
I washed the clams six times and they are cooking now.
If I tell my dad whats happening, hell tell the warden
That’s because you nearly lost me, Violet, said Benny.
It seems as though I have brought us here for nothing.
If I go anywhere, then the C Cubes secrets go with me.
Haven’t I told you no playing tug-of-war in the house?
I have sent the helmets tracker pattern to yourhelmet.
It was funny, Grandfather, said Jessie, half laughing.
It must be very small, the name is in such fine print.
How much are two and one? asked Benny in a loud voice.
I prefer anonymity, until I have something exceptional
I guess so, said Violet, smiling at her older sister .
This is going to be fun for you, Benny, said Mr. Smith
Not if you keep your fingers away from the electrodes.
Jim cocks his head as if he doesnt quite believe this.
Do you have any Idea what will happen if those cannons
Well, Percy, what’s the good word? asked Grandfather .
We do need help, but it’s too late to do anything now.
Imagine having five teachers in one year! said Benny .
Are you going to take her to a hospital? asked Henry .
If you werent looking, howd you know she was a looker?
I have isolated the location of the girl, saI'd Magus.
We have a picnic every meal, I should say, said Benny.
Yes, and we know more than that, said her grandfather.
I hope nothing breaks; I have no magic left to fix it.
I look like my father, a father I may never see again.
Well, my dear, Benny has a good head on his shoulders.
Every new teacher thinks we have forgotten everything.
Do you know the name of these yellow stones, Mr. Smith
Carter, looking at Violet with a smile, neither did I.
The important thing is that I have something you want.
We have to buy bread and bottles of milk, said Jessie.
Oh, we could all paint! shouted Benny, jumping around.
What’s the matter with him? Who is he? asked Mr. Smith
I’ve seen grown-up men fall down in here, going to see
an hour I may just instruct him to go to the bathroom.
Do you two have to start with the sparring right away?
I have sold a creature a person to the Extinctionists.
But we weren’t playing horses, Dad! protested Arthur .
We’ll find him if we have to cut down the whole woods.
I'd feel better in thattower room if you were with us.
Do you think we might find this mystery written down? 
Please let me walk into the lake, Alice, begged Benny.
But now I have to care about eight other planets, too.
I don’t see anything bad about the house, said Jessie.
We’ll be careful this time to leave everything just as
I’d never be tired of making pies, my dear! cried Mrs.
I tell her if shes good, I will bake her a lemon cake.
If I cannot have that lemur, then no one will have it.
If you believe the professor, saI'd Thatcher, Morocco.
By all means, said Aunt Jane, trying to hide a smile .
I would like to wash my own dishes, said Joe, smiling.
We’re going to live there too this summer, said Benny.
By the way, I need some stuffing for the fish tonight.
They are certainly better than nothing, said Mr. Smith
Please say ‘Lovan,’ said the Indian woman with a bow .
We’ve been in that refrigerator, said Benny, laughing.
Like allmegalomaniacs, she has a tendency to show off.
Do you think the black car has anything to do with all
Let’s not stand here in the rain talking, said Jessie.
Wish I could come and help you, said the man, smiling.
I have to hang upsIde down from the ceiling with this.
You can take a picture of Watch digging up an Indian! 
There’s no place for them to go, because I can see the
Then Stink worked on the letter as if it was homework.
It will have to be big for all those pies, said Benny.
He came crawling as fast as he could through the hole.
He may be a coin dealer, but he’s something else, too.
But I have heard that many lighthouses are being sold.
He’s sleepy, said Jessie, looking at her little watch.
Let’s go upstairs again and look at their lovely home.
That’s just what they tried to do to us, Violet said .
You were the one stealing all those eggs! said Benny .
I don’t think he will bring them back, said Miss Gray.
But let’s enjoy this lovely country with all the woods
Would you do me a favor here and look at my paperwork.
Why do you want all these pictures, Joe? asked Henry .
We should get there by nine o’clock, said Grandfather.
This makes me think of Blue Bay, said Violet, smiling.
I have to go now, before the satellite beam gets here.
We’ve missed it! The big caboose was just disappearing
After all, who cared if she scorched the shuttleshull.
A sign that youre cuckoo if you think you can keep him.
He is experimenting with seaweed and plankton for food.
Well, Freddy is getting into trouble, said Grandfather.
What were you going to say, Lars? asked Violet softly .
Here is another piece! said Jessie, handing it to Joe .
Good for you! What are you going to do with the money? 
Whatdo you imagine I have been doing for the past year?
He has found Ma Pigs new car and is bringing it to her.
He has stored enough methane to power Haven for a year.
Well, I had a bit of luck, I should say, said Mr. Smith
Well, you are right, said Grandfather nodding at Benny.
You have a lot of best friends, said the man, laughing.
But it’s best to fill it to keep it fromgetting bigger.
But why should he almost bump into Jessie? Henry asked.
You dont mind if he doesnt answer you himself; he might
I don’t mind having a Mystery Man at my birthday party.
But I wonder what your grandfather is going to do about
But if I find out any youll be the first doll Ill tell.
I don’t think it has any real name, said Joe, thinking.
Do you want to hold the puppy, Aunt Jane? asked Henry .
You never lived here long ago with all these goings-on.
How in the world do you get along alone? asked Jessie .
Carlos has been telling me of you in letters, she said.
Can’t take that fishing tackle, Henry, called Mr. Smith
BesIdes, I have a date to go skateboarding with Freddy.
What are you working on behind the house? asked Henry .
We’re always saying ’Let’s go!’ said Jessie, laughing .
You certainly are getting to be a very nice, kind boy! 
But you’re not going home for a long time yet, I hope? 
Do you think I'd go to all this trouble to share power?
We’ve got that gun over to my father’s house right now.
Everything seems better when we have to work to get it.
Where are you going, Henry? asked Grandfather sharply .
Well, if I may say so, Colonel, hes in the right place.
I have already organized a full crew and anextra pilot.
and some juice and ham too, if you have it, I tell her.
What’s your problem? Barry asked a moody-looking fish .
And if you dont start talking, then we move on to lucky
For a long time I carefully ate away on nothing at all.
Feel free to boot any human backsIde if it lags behind.
When I get back to the caboose I’m going to take a nap.
He’s nice, isn’t he? said Violet, as they walked along.
Bring your security blanket too, if it makes you happy.
Don’t forget the company, said Joe, winking at Jessie .
I don’t think you’re going to like your farm, Mr. Smith
Your presents will have to wait, Gramps, answered Mama.
a hut, too, said Benny, where someone has been staying.
Well, replied Benny slowly, I was thinking about Alice.
Well, no, I can’t really talk, came the horse’s voice .
I had my lunch, said Charley, but it’s supper time now.
Even if what you say were possible, how would you know?
There is something out there that the dog doesn’t like.
If he wrote more letters, he could get more free stuff.
If she retreats now,Jayjay will be free of her forever.
If I can keep this away from her, at least, he thought.
They all watched the smoke still coming from the cave .
If he weremore subdued than normal, he had good reason.
The air might be neededif he encountered any obstacles.
If you wish to return here, I need to stay as a marker.
Im afraI'd I may have put your human friends in danger.
Then he told them about the dogs turning around to dig.
The child would be in danger if she were found with me.
I should like to see that gun very much, said Mr. Smith
I never have to call him, said David, shaking his head.
Today we’re going to review subtraction with borrowing,
We had quarreled and I never did learn the baby’s name.
We had a wonderful time seeing your new home, said Mrs.
They took fifteen years off, and I have a Kevlar chest.
They’re all broke, said Benny, picking up some shells .
I will say you were going down to get the dog yourself.
I think it’s going to be the best thing about this pie.
I think we have enough, said Henry, looking at the pan.
Oh, I’m hungry, said Benny, and here’s the Golden Horn.
That is the best thing I have heard yet, said Mr. Smith
So what do you think you should do, my dearest Mervall?
That was, of course, if he managed to get underground .
Keep this up and I may choose not to marry your sister.
Let’s go right home and put them in water! Violet said.
She’s awfully pretty, said Benny, as they came nearer .
Nothing—just the stuffing is coming out of my mattress.
She saI'd if I come early, Ill be able to meet somebody
No, said Benny, and I never saw a talking horse either.
No, you come another day and swing, said Lars suddenly.
Its as if Im doing somethingright every time I see him.
It seems as if we are always looking for lost people or
Oh, let’s talk about the farm, Grandfather, said Benny.
Is he coming back? asked Benny, getting ready to howl .
It must be lonesome for him living all alone on the top
Jifaar sighed heavily, as if he carried a great burden.
I’m going right to Glass Factory and buy my horse back.
That’s enough for a beginning, said Henry, standing up.
I’ll have to break the top off, I’m afraid, said Henry.
I’m afraid Bill is getting very tired, he said to them.
I heard something new about Larry’s father, said Benny.
We made it! We made it! they shouted, jumping for joy .
I have them on my neck too, creeping closer to my face.
you only like her because she has a great throwing arm.
I have wondered every day if he managed tomake it home.
Hey, you try to remote-destruct this helmet if you like.
Maybe it’s because you’re eating too much, said Sister .
You must come to the little hut to see Joe, said Benny .
It is enormous! These must have cost you a fortune, rew.
Everyone in town knows that, said the captain, laughing.
Room for you! said Violet going over to her grandfather.
We are going to explore, said Henry, taking the kettle .
I have it, saI'd Trouble, locating the dot on his radar.
I have to turn myself in, even if I am a murder suspect.
If youre feeling cocky, its because theres something you
That’s why he took it up into the woods to fool with it.
Hey! I’m going to the meadow to fly my new pusher plane.
I must look in the refrigerator, she said with a laugh .
It’s a busy time for me with the quilting bee coming up.
Its right in front of his nose and he hasnt noticed yet?
Why would you want us to be scared of you? Katie asked .
I have some experience with this sort of thing, he saId.
It’s a long time since we stopped for lunch, said Henry.
She looked tired andalmost as if she were going to cry .
Don’t we have the most exciting adventures! cried Benny.
If I dont do something, Ill go stir-crazy, she admitted.
Dont you mock my birthmark, which I may or may not have.
Don’t tell Aunt Jane that we are going back to that hut.
Then again he couldnt make a move if he was unconscious.
If she couldnt play baseball, you wouldnt be her friend.
But if I dId, I might repeat that I dont have any magic.
He didn’t know a thing about the money sewed in my coat.
All of the dogs who joinButtons I have known personally.
He didn’t know then that tomorrow would be so exciting .
He looked all around, but he didn’t see any more bunks .
Trees growing right in the water out there! cried Benny.
Tomorrow we’ll have to eat bread and milk, said Jessie .
If we are going to cook that hamburger we’ll have to get
He is asking to see you and Theo, so I have arranged for
You shall go back and get your things and stay here this
I should think he could understand that, wherever he is.
Good for you, Benny, said his grandfather, much pleased.
But if we start very early tomorrow morning, we ought to
Well, what do you know! said Benny, in a very low voice.
I don’t dare try it, Grandfather, said Henry, frowning .
Go elsewhere, if you must hunt, but get out of my sight.
What do you think Ive been telling you for the last five
I think it’s Pat, said Mike, still staring at the boat .
If you dIdnt know better, youd swear there was dwarf gas
Hall, when I saw the sign HALL’S GROCERY, said Mr. Smith
Grandfather thinks it’s going to get cold, said Jessie .
There is one thing that’s missing, though, said Jessie .
Yes, and who else do you think is going? asked Mr. Smith
Remember you haven’t had supper, and it’s eight o’clock.
Yes, Papa, said Brother, looking up from his airplanes .
That’s an arrowhead, and that’s an ax-head, and that’s a
Do the rules say what to do if your big sister goofs up?
I want you to see the spring where the water comes from.
Your concern wouldbe touching, if it extended to myself.
Yes, I know he is, said Jessie, pulling up the blanket .
You don’t need to growl any more, Spotty, said Mr. Smith
I have to do something quicklybefore hebut its too late.
What are you going to use for bait, Henry? asked Benny .
I like to have you with us, Mike, said Violet, laughing.
Well, I’ve been working for you, but you didn’t know it.
Captain Short, I have orders to blow you out of the air.
Carter, now? asked Violet just in time to stop a fight .
By this time the family was watching from therear deck .
You can’t say it isn’t, because you all stopped digging.
Can you tell me where you saw this manand the young boy?
She has such an exciting place to live on Mystery Ranch.
Larry would trust young people more than he would a man.
Yes, my dear, it is a great thing to discover an artist.
Let’s come here early some morning and dig, said Jessie.
Let’s begin again and look everything over, Benny said .
How do you know what brains look like, Ben? asked Mike .
As the dwarfs saId, he couldnt make a decision if he was
Do you remember the first time we had real butter in the
But what do we care? We bought some paints and things in
I will stay in the hut until you tell me it’s all right.
Would you like to help me put him back where he belongs?
Will you tell us everything the men find? asked Jessie .
We can take some things with us, too, said Grandfather .
As if in answer, the flap of their tent was yanked open.
We think that Joe is more than a handy man, said Henry .
Would you be so good as to describe my mothers symptoms?
I’d like to peek in and see if he’s there, said Violet .
I’m going to see Old Beaver every week on my motorcycle.
Bisa saId, What if you do not like the answers you find?
Do you know what you have to do to begin breathing fire?
But I have a feeling that all your spell-casting in some
wanna be that Recon babe if she gets in the way of this.
I want to see every single thing you have, said Mr. Smith
What about these things we brought with us? asked Gramps.
If it is a real ruby, it is worth more than the diamonds.
If she wereinfectious, wouldnt we have caught it already?
They told me I could tell you two days after the wedding.
I have math and spelling, and Stink gets pajama homework.
What do I have to do to get a bit of respect around here?
Help! A monster! she cried, pretending to be frightened .
My father gulps as if he swallowed one of his toothpicks.
Sea biscuit? said Mike looking at the picture on the box.
There’s a sign over the door that says, ‘Welcome, Dads’! 
I bet it’s another man to work on the house, said Henry .
How much do you want? asked the man who was the foreman .
I will never let you beat me! cried Carlos, tugging back.
I asked if I might have a look at your box, saI'd Ciaran.
I’m going to put this blanket under meinstead of over me.
I’m staying in the blue house with my good neighbor, Mrs.
I’m going to have to take Speedy’s wheel out of his cage.
Do you know how long it would take to build a wall out of
I’m sure they were pointing at the big caboose and at us.
We want to ask you just a few more things, Bill, he said.
But this is safer for swimming than Blue Bay, said Henry.
It wouldn’t be a thing; it would be a man, said Mr. Smith
And if he was, would that make him feel better, or worse?
She has an unusual style, but she is a Butler, after all.
Do you happen to know the password for Artemiss firewall?
You are sure then that everything is all right? Mr. Smith
She has some oddthings on the list too, like a full moon.
I told you Grandfather was up to something, said Jessie .
And secondly, sure you can come with me, if you dont mind
Let’s wash the dishes and pick the peas now, said Jessie.
Yes, I guess that is the word, said Grandfather, smiling.
Joe and I are going to try to find out what they all are.
I have time tonight to make Benny’s cart, remarked Henry.
The swimming pool should be three times as deep, he said.
Sergei was alone, and if he was not, something was wrong.
He climbed up on Henry’s back like a monkey and stood up.
But if he let Qwan keep talking, every one of his secrets
You run a string from the cross straight to the red rock.
He knew them, but if he feared them, itcould not be seen.
You think Bill’s brother wrote the letter? asked Jessie .
He doesn’t seem like a Mystery Man any more, said Violet.
What if she throws a tantrum with the bar spreader in her
Imagine, if you will, the catastrophic effects of burping
And I have no doubt they are concentrating on tracing the

Do you want us to take him outsIde for a little accIdent?
It is shorter walking on the sand than through the woods.
If you were invisible to man and machine, I would be more
If you needed help, why dIdnt you call on your own phone?
I have to stop this! Katie said to herself as she chewed.
I have my orders, and believe me theyre written in stone.
I don’t like the idea of strange men bothering Aunt Jane.
Oh, I’m all tired out thinking! cried Aunt Jane suddenly.
Well, it wasn’t much, said Benny, but it got me thinking.
forth between her two feet as if shes on a rocking horse.
Well, Mike, what do you think about that! shouted Benny .
Best that ever I saw, agreed Captain Daniel, waving, too.
Because I’m interested in things like that, answered Joe.
She’s found news about our mystery from an old, old book.
I have a friend in Virginia Beach who started a business.
We are pretty lucky to have anything to eat, said Violet.
Those men at the store thought of everything, said Benny.
but she is unable to guess what surprise he has in store.
giants bathtub (if you just happened to know any giants).
We’ll find him just the same, said Rita shaking her head.
Please don’t talk with your mouth full, Arthur, Mr. Smith
I have plenty of rocks for you to chew back in the Deeps.
Oh, yes! Take all the small things to put in your museum.
I dont suppose youd like to play your old man, would you?
We’ll show you, said Henry, if it’s all right with Larry.
Well, I won’t bet against you, said Grandfather, smiling.
I guess you’ve noticed all the bees visiting the flowers.
I have good men searching all the way down to Green Cape.
Are we going to live in that yellow house? cried Jessie .
Well, that’s the way people are up here, said Grandfather.
scoff at her, and was ready to defend her if he needed to.
Downwind, ofcourse, and I have mentioned that once before.
Spotty must have seen him come into the cellar, said Mike.
If it had been me, I would have asked for double chocolate
And can you guess what youll find when you do cut through?
She is making a pie, maybe, and we could have some to eat.
If I had some rotten fruit, I would throw it, added Foaly.
He’s a good looking boy, thought Violet when she met him .
Its far easier for me if you take off and land at the same
It’s the female flowers that make the seeds that grow into
She could feel her teethgetting shorter with each nibble .
It’s never a good thing to be late for school, Kevin, Mrs.
But I know your friends are going to give you some things.
Stop that fussing! he said in his loudest Papa Bear voice.
Heshould have remembered that, if he had been here before.
I dont know if youre supposed to call a convict sir, and I
Do you want to come over and look at some of them? You can
He’s the man we have been running away from all this time.
Grandfather, he said, do you mind if I ask you something? 
Go down and get him, if you wish, saI'd Vassikin sullenly.
The queer grating noise came from this room, said Jessie .
Someone sat on that milking stool and ate from that plate.
Then you know what happens if you do anything to upset me.
Four hundred and ninety-nine point five, if you must know.
Now, Benny, don’t say anything about seeing him out in his
He kept wondering why Freddy had invited him and Mr. Smith
We’d better be careful not to send any more down on top of
But if I dont explain whats happening, shelltell for sure.
The train is backing up! There is Al on the back platform.
No, you have to go ashore for drinking water and supplies.
He and the Aldens were glad to see how pleased Larry was .
If you dont mind, Ill leave the explaining to someone more
Always looking for excitement, y, said Aunt Jane smiling .
Even his cap was too small for him, said Henry, laughing .
We are making the swimming pool so that we can keep clean.
You must be tired with all that work, and I am tired, too.
But let’s not tell her the news too suddenly, Jessie said.
That’s what the microscope here is for, said Henry slowly.
You were wrong to go off without telling anyone, she said.
Foaly consulted his computer, as if he dIdnt already know.
You were always very kind to me, and gave me things to eat
Awfully hot, aren’t they? said Henry, burning his fingers.
If she could hit any one, the entire house would collapse.
In that big empty building at the mine office, said Henry.
Everything is molecular, and if you pack gigabytes of data
As long as we are warm we can stand being a little hungry.
Carter, my mother works hard at her washing, but she don’t
And if he got more freestuff, hed be like a bazillionaire!
Well, let’s go on, said Henry, and see where the water is.
I hear a funny noise over that way, said Violet, pointing.
Your uncle has almost worn himself out worrying about you.
I have them, crowed Spiro, his hands two fists of triumph.
Oh, a secret? Grandfather’s secret, I suppose, said Henry.
I am prepared to invest everything I have in this project.
even if it hadnt been, Root would not have used his visor.
You dont have to believe me if you dont want to, Mr. Smith
Your appetite was all right before, said Henry, laughing .
A ladle, of all things! cried Henry Where did you get it? 
Like everybody has their own smell, except if youre twins.
Let me tell you something about that color, said Mr. Smith
No, that’s the trouble with them both, agreed the captain.
I’m going to teach this baby bird to waddle, Goose added .
It’s very nice to see you, he said in a deep, jolly voice.
You can see every single thing after they have dug it out.
But you children spend all your time making me happy, too.
Disembark is a pretty gentle term for what I have in mind.
Just one thing, said Jessie, looking at her gentle sister.
That is just like you, Violet, said Henry, smiling at her.
Would you like for us to join you at the museum afterward?
Katie Kazoo! Then he started chanting, Katie Kazoo, Kati e
Yes, that’s a picture of the old station at Glass Factory.
I have been a statuefor ten thousand years because of you.
You have never seen the rest of us, said Jessie, laughing.
These boys have been training all year, remarked the man .
I’ll have to buy some heavy clothes if I work outdoors and
Just exactly the same! cried Benny, sitting down suddenly.
Would either of you mind if I borrowed Mister Spiros Cube?
Foaly, can you put me through to Mister Kongs mobile phone.
Keep something moving, even if its only your little finger.
I shall want to assess if she is the One before I kill her.
Of course, if you were human,you shot the bird then ate it.
By the time he got to Z, the other kids were all giggling .

footsteps, and do you think she will make a good bodyguard?
What is that thing on the tracks ahead of us? Benny asked .
We’ll all read about Isabelle’s boat tomorrow, said Benny .
The wreck must have been quite far away, said Grandfather .
Well, what’s the matter with this house? That was long ago.
Goodness! I hope they’re not playing for keeps! said Mama .
What’s the matter, Jessie? called Benny in a sleepy voice .
Maybe we should save our food for the morning, Violet said.
You bark all you want to now, Watch, said Violet, laughing.
I have the most important job on Earth, more important than
Thanks, Mister Arnott, you may just have caught a murderer.
Well, yes—she is lovely now, said her grandfather, smiling.
It would be exciting if Peter were really here, said Henry.
It will be better if she doesnt feel were gangingup on her.
Do you suppose Bill’s brother hid the money in this house? 
I’m going into the office for a few minutes, said Mr. Smith
Who were the men Aunt Jane was talking about? asked Henry .
Do you mind being the only female elf in the LEPrecon Unit?
You had something all planned for this summer, Grandfather.
But sometimes the fishing is poor, so he works on odd jobs.
It’s the sardine factory! A school of sardines has come in.
It’s something like an old country hotel with six rooms for
Do you think that fellow was a ‘bad apple’? asked Brother .

Maybe I can help around the place, to pay for taking us in.

Do you think I relish the Idea of crawling to this Mud Boy?

Ever since I met you something nice has happened every day.
I’m sure they’ll be calm andsensible about the whole thing.
And if she ever lost those principles, perhaps I would lose

Everything is okay, said Henry, looking at his grandfather.

I may have to be content with the hundred thousand for now.
Well, obviously I have the lemur, so can we please proceed?
We are writing down the old stories in the Indian language.
Do you know why Grandfather doesn’t like to talk about it? 
I may be a prisoner, fishboy, but in ten years Ill be free.
Listen, Arty,if you know someone who might be able to help.
Well, now, said Jim, the first thing, don’t you get scared.
Al is going to put a torpedo on that other track behind us.
My insIdes are not as old as my outsIdes, if you must know.
Outside is an entire field of La Abuela’s secretingredient.
They are just sitting over there on the rocks, said Henry .
Henry and Alice will carry one with the things still in it.
No pie for me? asked Benny, taking his grandfather’s hand .
We’re going to blast, Benny! Joe called over the telephone.
If there weren’t any, this boat wouldn’t have had a fishing
If I dont do a complete blood substitution soon, there will
If youre wounded, lie as still as you can until I get back.
There’s all of August and part of September, said Mr. Smith
If I cant convince you in a single minute, then I will hang
Then they laughed, for they had all agreed to keep trying .
There’s nothing on that point but sand and water and rocks.
So you’re James Alden’s grandchildren! a sharp voice said .
I told you it was a dumb thing to take that vase, one said.
I can just imagine what would happen if he found the roses.
So how come you were screaming like that? Ricky continued .
I came all this way just like you, and she’s not even here.
He says that we ought to spend more money getting food from
If I leave him here, he will probably get himself arrested.
If he was any good as a shrink, he wouldve seen that coming.
If you were afraid of dogs, it wouldn’t be such a bad thing.
I don’t think you can do anything with his father, Mr. Smith
Why are you standing there? Chef Lillou barked at his staff.
What’s the most important subject a witch learns in school? 
Why do you think people will laugh at you? Katie asked him .
Maybe hands, said Henry, laughing and looking at his hands .
When you were picking cherries, I went up to see your house.
Maybe it’s a little wooden door!  all covered with plaster! 
We’ll have to paddle right along to make camp for the night.
If its too smelly, we cant have it aboard the space shuttle.
I feel as if it were my birthday, said Joe, looking at him .
I have to neutralize them before I pass out, thought Butler.
I have to groom the best people to take over when I am gone.
When we go down, said Benny, how about letting me go first? 
Where can we buy some cement? asked Henry, stopping the car.
Maybe if your bodyguard hadnt plugged me with a dart  twice.
Don’t you remember we are going back to the mainland and buy
Let’s see if these stones can possibly be moved, said Benny.
What better thing could we do for Lovan? She will feel free,
I think we’ll eat in the kitchen, said Henry looking around.
She has that fuzzy look, like someone who needs to sleep for
But you both play pretty well, she added, so it’s up to you.
I know, but what kind of mini-programs do you have on there?
Just think of Grandfather’s getting all these! cried Jessie.
This is a perfect day to work on our museum things, he said.
You dIdnt fall asleepyesterday because I dIdnt do your head.
But if you want my help, I will require something in return.
Let’s give this heavy bag of oats to Sam first, said Henry .
Let’s get out of here! shouted Henry, starting for the door.
I try to make my voice sound as if I believe what Im saying.
How can we put spring water into a can of milk? Benny asked.
Suzanne, will you please put a carrot in Speedy’s cage? Mrs.
My, that smells good! cried Maggie, coming into the kitchen.
Master Artemis, I have had some experience in these matters.
He’s much too nice to live in a hut on somebody else’s land.
It’s got that hole in it, so it isn’t worth anything at all.
It’s the most I have had for two weeks, anyway, said Maggie.
Boy! You’ve got a big one, cried Joe, stopping to look back.
Perry, you may take the last two hoursbefore dawn with Carl.
I like stew even better today, said Henry, eating hungrily .
She has been amusing herself by tucking the babys covers all
Well, one day Chi-Chi was showing the diamonds to everybody.
I will get anything you want and I shall be back in an hour.
If you see that man again, tell him to lay off the red meat.
Benny and I think the men were watching us, too, Henry said.
See that man having his breakfast on that boat? said Jessie.
He is clearly asking her if its okay for him to look insIde.
I have since applied the same technique to my general scans.
The fuss about Father’s Day is a lot of nonsense, said Papa.
If you go beyond three days, then you are stuck in the past.
Morse said we wouldn’t like it, something must be wrong with
Actually, now that you mention it, I have a bio-bomb to arm.
I have my family and friends around me thanks to the People.
What kind of nightmares would you like to give theParadizos?
But I’m glad she gave the ranch to us instead of selling it.
Maybe there’s nothing for him to bark at now, said Mr. Smith
Its not as if its the first time weve saved the fairy world.
What in the world are you two talking about? asked Mr. Smith
less than a perfect report, even if it was only Kraken Watch.
Stop at the store, Henry, and buy a trowel, said Grandfather.
Natalie stays with me as if she is suddenly glued to my sIde.
It was plain that she wanted to try living on the houseboat .
Oh, Mama, may I come meet Santa Bear? Please, may I? Please? 
Hey, Mulch, if you listen really hard you can just about make
Oh, no, he sleeps down the cellar when he’s home, said Mike .
If you persist with this baby talk I will have to punish you.
What are we going to do now, Jessie? Benny asked his sister .
Better than nothing, Jess, said Henry, looking at his sister.
Let me look up trains, said Henry, getting up from the floor.
I have two parents and a bodyguard already trying to do that.
Look at that daddy robin helping that mamarobin build a nest.
Stanley Lambchop, you tasted the secret ingredient, said Mrs.
There was Holly, wondering if her weapon would arrive intact.
Sheswearing her church clothes and she has her baseball gear?
And even if I dId, the local police would be here in minutes.
That’s all right, Henry, said the Mystery Man, smiling again.
I hope it’s not going to rain, said Jessie, as she lay down .
People say that he is always taking that boat out after dark.
And even if he is, he wont be with us for more than a second.
And once I have little Jayjay I can open my own hole in time.
Would you take my photo? he said with a smooth French accent.
It’s near a very big pile of shells on the end of the island.
I have a feeling the Abominable Snowman will be no different.
A pudding? Oh, yes, I remember what a pudding is, said Peter.
That’s quite a plan, said the lieutenant with a little laugh.

The sun was shining, but somewater still fell from the trees.
It’s just what people say and how they feel about this place.
Sure! Suzanne said, yanking her skirt up to her bellybutton .
Will these turn red, too? asked Benny, looking at the claws .
How do you do? asked Barry, proudly waving his fish fingers .
If you do not have some serious psychosis, you will be sorry.
You tell that pixie that if he helps us out hes a free fairy.
What would he say if it was his father miraculously returned?
Look! said Mama, pointing to a deer at the edge of the woods.
paperwork and no mention of his name if it could be recorded.
David, what’s on your mind? What are you afraid of? Mr. Smith
If he dIdnt come up with something, Searle would win the box.
It’s too bad it’s such a sad place and nobody can live there.
Well see if you can die as slowly as the small beagle yonder.
I don’t see any company, though, said Benny, looking around .
Oh, let’s wait! Jessie said, looking at Aunt Jane and y Bean.
Well, you’re right, boy, if you are thinking mostly of Lovan.
I have a disorder which the fairies call an Atlantis Complex.
He caught a sheet of paper that was blowing down to the sand.
Of course they didn’t find anything if they didn’t even look.
The water runs around the ends every time! What shall we do? 
I’ve had enough fun just camping, even if we don’t find Bill.
That’s why Bill took the rowboat that night and came up here.
That’s because you’re not in all over, said Jessie, laughing.
Then you must know Carmen del Junco, the famous bullfighter! 
Well, I don’t know about the smile, said the driver laughing.
My cogitations can take hours, especially if I have red meat.
That’s where Larry does his experiments—at least we think so.
Do you know anything about a big postman named Sid Weston who
If you can do anything to change my mind, now is your chance.
You better swear swear, double swear, hope to die if you lie.
Pardon me if I dont completely trust my intellect these days.
Yes, but best of all, they like to make something of nothing.
But it’s all Aunt Jane has, and we don’t want to take it away
Appearances can be deceiving—what’s that mean? asked Sister .
Do you by any chance know what happened to the ladys husband?
No need to go hunting Spiro if all he has is a box of useless
You were going to sell the coins to the Adams College Museum.
Ill bet she could make it through this mess if she dI'd that.
What’s the matter with the wind, Joe? asked Benny sitting up.
Your father says there is something strange about this place.
Maybe if you dIdnt insist on blocking all the circuit boards.
It is the first time hehas said more than one word at a time.
If it will stop the pain once its back in place, its worthit.
Right here, said Benny, going to the other side of the pile .
If it does, the police could tieone of us up for a long time.
I dont need a grammar lesson, Foaly, just zoom in, would you?
We are working with the FBI, really, Ben, said Mike proudly .
If it was, then Madam Scargill wouldsurely notice it missing.
Nats faced theother way as if she cant bear to look at Willy.
I have jacked into your helmet and sent a malfunctionmessage.
Henry will have to give you a lobster for finding this float.
We’ll have to have a line to dry the towels on, said Jessie .
Grandfather won’t have time to go fishing, Benny, said Henry.
Boy, it was a good thing you were late today, Kevin told her.
There is nothing much on it except a small house, a barn, and
But I have a confession: I actually prefer Montserrat Caball.
Foaly, you have free rein, if youll pardon the horse analogy.
Even if you tear off the roof, you cant come into this house.
He has her walk back through, triggering the snitch box again.
Well, said Benny, that is the funniest looking gun I ever saw.
Just as if someone were testing something, said Violet slowly.
But if I dont go, we could all be dead in a matter of minutes.
Ian, she saId, what I have to say is for Theodosias ears only.
I began wondering when he got us all those books, said Violet.
Let’s call this end of the island ‘Indian Point,’ said Henry .
That’s quite young for a person over a hundred, said Mr. Smith
I wouldnt be throwing that word around so much, if I were you.
I have already secured the mining permits from the government.
here we are, going to blast the top off the cave! said Benny .
If you could only know what I have been through to find little
I’m glad, said Benny, getting into the boat and sitting down .
Do you live in a blocked toilet, Mister Fatty Chocolate Fairy?
Oh, dear! Do we all have to go to bed so early? asked Violet .
As if in answer, Najib waved and the procession started again.
Those twins live in my own town, and here I sit writing books.
Do not cry, chef, Patrice said as he patted Lillou’s shoulder.
I miss Grandfather, and he must have been lonesome, even if he
Do you know anything about the old Alden farm up on the hill? 
Holly, if I ever dI'd anything to offend you, I unreservedly  
The worst case, ya say?’ said Gramps, looking Papa in the eye.
I have no desire to get involved in a firefight in a high-rise
The trees are getting few and far between on the mountainside.
But you always let us do things in summer when there isn’t any
Then doesn’t the engine use this track any more? asked Benny .
If you would seethese safely down to the sloop, Master Lawson?
But if youre not with us in five minutes, Im coming after you.
Well, Benny, you are asking for trouble, said Henry laughing .
Why do I have a feeling that you know more than youre telling?
If you mess with me now, in the mIddle of an operation, I wont
If I remember the sequence of events correctly, after you shot
The babys cries are piercing now, as if he senses Pipers fear.
If I spend my time talking to Purdy, shes not gonna like that.
If she is dead, at least it will clear the way for a bio-bomb.
If she behaves herself, Ill permither to travel next Saturday.
This boy lives in the woods, and he cuts vines and everything.
Hecould only imagine what would happen if he lost his footing.
This old climbing tree might be a good spot for it, said Papa.
Now you sit down in the engineer’s seat, Benny, said Mr. Smith
Professor, would you like to explain to the boys what you told
Let’s lay the first ones between these two trees, said Jessie.
her mind to turn down the promotion if it were offered to her.
But I have no wish to add you to the list of lost negotiators.
Do you think we could find any wampum here, Joe? asked Henry .
It’s just the picture, said Mike, taking it out of his pocket.
Alden, walking down to the station wagon, I don’t mind at all.
I have my pocket torch, but wed be better off with more light.
I thought he worked in a museum, but was taking some time off.
There’s enough trouble already in that house between Mr. Smith
You’ll like the country store, Ben, said Henry, walking along.
But if you forget anything, you can stop and buy more down the
Rawley licence to do what he has wanted to do for a long time.
You must have seen pictures of museums; places where they keep
What shall I do with the vegetables I pulled up? Henry asked .
Well, Jessie said, we don’t have to worry about Watch anymore.
In fact, it’s the worst case of messy build-up I’ve ever seen !
Your cells will thank me in fifty years, if youre still around.
Now you’ve got something there, brother! I am hungry as a bear.
Let’s go up to the house and get our swimming suits and towels.
I made it with the seasoning that Carlos’s mother gave me, Mrs.
Oh, what has happened to Benny? said Jessie, beginning to cry .
I’ve been thinking aboutSanta Bear and what a hard job he has .
Then we’ll be sure to have some dinner, said Jessie, laughing .
Isn’t this great, flying along! said Benny after a few minutes.
Papa had chopped down a tree and was splitting it into boards .
If we hear anyone, said Jessie, we must hide behind the bushes.
He is wearing a hat, but you can’t see if it isKeep on tapping.
I am going to keep mine, said Benny, very pleased with himself.
The Museum people were delighted with all the things, said Joe.
my grandma’s got a big box of old valentines, said her brother.
Ross told us the Cook boy takes his father’s boat out at night.
He would doubtless have stepped off the patch, if hed had time.
I was hoping he would have a roof over his head when it rains .
He told me if I had the implants, then I could live in America.
They said it was somebody hiding in this house!  that’s why the
If she could just get a birds eye view on the targets, it would
Three men came while we were buying groceries, Violet answered.
Do you remember the sweet spot on thebomb I strapped to Julius?
I mean, if it dI'd break your jaw for real, wouldnt you be mad?
We must have knives and forks, spoons, and pans, too, said Mrs.
Do you want me to help you, Benny? asked Jessie laughing, too .
Let’s go down to the very end of the island today, said Henry .
Well, that just goes to show that appearances can be deceiving.
We have more company, Mother, Larry said, pointing to the car .
Well, said Benny, I’ve been reading about that place in school.
We can surely find something to eat when we get to Old Village.
There’s no good living here, if you can’t have your own things.
Oh, let’s just watch the river for a little while, said Violet.
Put in some milk, Violet, said Jessie, and stir them some more.
But this family loves animals, and we can’t help noticing them.
How are you going to get out? asked Jessie as she looked down .
I think the birds are the best thing in the museum, said Benny.
Oh, Jessie! Isn’t that something? They are two twins, I guess! 
But they were making such a commotion theydidn’t even hear him.
It just seems strange, because it’s the very thing I used to do
A little salt, she laughed, and Aunt Jane’s breakfast is ready.
How do you know the goblins arent just ripping off wholesalers?
Stink Moody, saI'd Riley, how many times do I have to tell you?
Not a very good meal, but we can’t have everything on a far-off
I think he’s more interested in it as science work, said Henry.
So you’re not afraid of me anymore, huh? he asked her finally .
I was counting stitches and didn’t hear a word you were saying.
saI'd Mulch, as if he had no Idea what they were talking about.
We have this new guy, and he was working on the computer when .
Do you know what you want to do with the money? asked Mr. Smith
He did not think Mike really knew anything about the stranger .
It shows us we’ll have to be very careful of Bill, said Jessie.
No, Jessie! We can think of something else tomorrow, said Mike .
I bet Freddy is trying to sell them something, whispered Benny .
Carter answered, looking at all the surprised faces around him .
No, he said, it is so cold that I’m not going to get out of bed.
Let’s go and help them settle things for the night, said Benny .
Coming back up the river, you have to use the motor on the back.
Don’t you remember I said I would look more like Bill McGregor? 
Here is the same old pitcher and teapot, said Jessie, laughing .
I never told where Joe and Alice went on their wedding trip, did
Oh, what a fine fountain this is! said Henry, running toward it.
Robin, said Papa, I think Mama and the cubs are up to something.
It would be awful if you bought things, and then people gave you
I shouldn’t think it would get very cold in August, said Henry .
Violet, ordered Jessie, please wet my handkerchief in the brook.
We love it here, and I think Aunt Jane is used to having us now.
It must be supper, said Henry, for soon we’ll have to go to bed.
Maybe it’s the milk and butter and pepper and salt that I smell.
I think it gets better all the time, said Mike, swinging gently.
But later I found out he was going to give it to some friends of
We’ll take them along, too, said Papa, handing him another box .
Then why do you think he would be mean to you? asked the woman .
Good! said Grandfather Alden, looking at his four grandchildren.
I don’t know, but insurance will take care of some things later.
Well, this is a great place for getting news around, said Jeff .
He said the men are going to blast the cave open! shouted Benny.
In summer he hasn’t anything else to do except watch the trains.
do I see the end of that red car sticking out behind the house? 
Just like airplanes landing on an airplane carrier, said Benny .
She says ‘Good morning’ and ‘Good night’ and ‘Hello, Peter,’ and
I’m glad it is hot, said Henry, for we must sleep on the ground.
They are for the kind people who helped me get out of my burning
Nice to see you too,Mulch, even if you dI'd sink one of my subs.
Notice the man doll sitting in that easy chair? He is six inches
I’m going to take my paints and make pictures of things we find.
I’m going to use these little onions for the chowder, she said .
Let’s take it to the hut, and I will give you your first lesson.
I suppose the most important thing is not to talk, added Benny .
All right, Stockings it is, agreed Jessie, trying not to laugh .
True, Miz McGrizz is old and bent and rather forbidding looking.
If I could rIde the wind in Canada to the Northwest Territories,
But even if he should stealthings, what can we do, Grandfather? 
Do you think anyone hid there from the Redcoats during the war? 
How about the things inside? The washing machine? asked Jessie .
We mustn’t let the stove get wet, cried Henry, speaking out loud.
My name is Browning, he said as he sat down in the company chair.
You will come over many times when we get to digging, said Alice.
My family can sleep here tonight without worrying about anything.
erson said I must keep very still if I saw anyone on this island.
Now supposing this treasure was yours and somebody else found it.
Somebody should throw some oil on that hamster! George exclaimed.
Thanks, Henry! It was really more important than finding islands.
Good! cried Henry, who liked Violet’s little pictures very much .
Also, said Papa, I want to thank you for the Papa’s Day Surprise.
If you wont speak to me like you dI'd in the tunnel, then you may
The first thing we’ll need is a big sign that ‘NO BOYS ALLOWED’! 
Then he thought surely Benny would say something about his sister
What outrageous, disgraceful, embarrassing behavior! said Sister.
Violet went quickly over to the steps and took the old man’shand.
Why is that red board floating out there? asked Benny, pointing .
Do you think we ought to talk with the hermit, Joe? asked Henry .
I mean it could be in something we look at everyday, said Benny .
Where shall we put the grease, Grandfather, when we get through? 
Está liso como un plato, a little girl said, gasping, wide-eyed .
Why did this have to be my first wish to come true? Katie yelped.
What could be more important than Lovan’s treasure? cried Benny .
They raced for the tools, leaving Bennyand Violet with the stick.
I wonder if someone is cooking in that little house, said Henry .
How do you know, old fellow? How do the Beans know? asked Henry .
I can’t have a whole third-grade class running around the school.
It certainly doesn’t belong in a small town like Pomfret Landing.
I could go to sleep standing on my head, said Mike, upside down .
I suppose that’s why we drink orange juice every day, said Mike .
Ulp! said Sister, waiting for him to reach for those big yankers.
On that trail you have to go miles in a canoe, and then carry the
There is just one thing you girls must promise me, said Mr. Smith
To this day, nobody knows what Bill was doing in that front room.
I think Joe went over to the mainland this morning, said Violet .
I know it was exciting for the boys, but I didn’t like it at all.
Let’s go down to the wharf and see what is going on, said Benny .
Well, as Benny would say, ‘A Mystery Man,’ said Violet, smiling .
Dear me, said Grandfather, I must be more careful about my face! 
Come on, like this, said Benny, going in on his hands and knees .
I think we’ll have to pack another box at the house, said Henry .
Last night I felt as if I were sitting on the steps of the little
The staging has to be strong to hold the workmen and the machines.
Let’s run up and get two big spoons and the dishpan, cried Jessie.
I know I never saw anything like it before, not even in a picture.
Is it deeper than a tree? asked Benny, still looking at the spot .
Isn’t this fun, Violet? Look how fast the men are making shelves! 
We will get your bear if we don’t get anything else, said Jessie .
You’ll have to, if Grandfather says so, Mikey old boy! said Benny.
I guess you learned something today, too, young man, said Freddy .
If you want to land, you canuse those two poles to push it ashore.
A cannibal would not teach the myna bird to say things in English.
Something sure smells good, said Brother, speaking into the phone.
I shall be thinking of Joe and Alice, and the little yellow house.
They caught them anyway, said Benny, So no more trouble from them.
Those trees are not growing in the water, Benny, said Grandfather.
Alden, to see you all sitting around doing schoolwork in vacation.
We found something else, too, but we forgot to bring it, he said .
Brother? Does this brother have anything to do with this mystery? 
Are you going to use your new spoons today, Jessie? asked Violet .
No, Miss Violet, not afraid, but we are all going to get very wet.
Oh, but I want to cook just once more on the stove, cried Jessie .
Of course it will hurt you, if she says mean things! cried Jessie.
There are some things right on the floor of the cave that are very
Shhhhh …, Goose hushed, pointing at the round thing beneath them .
My family won’t know I am lost until it’s supper time, said Benny.
Hey! You should never put your dirty foot on an egg, Duck scolded.
There’s a postman! Do you suppose he would have any mail for you? 
He waswalking with his hands in his pockets and he was whistling .
That costs the most of anything, doesn’t it, Aunt Jane? The family
But why will we get wet? Do you think we’ll fall out of the boat? 
I’m going to buy something from the cafeteria, she whispered back.
It was a very good idea, said Henry, having Mike’s Mother’s Place.
But she couldn’t help liking that friendly voice saying Aunt Jane.
Well, said Grandfather, if you forget anything, we can come again.
Will somebody bring flowers for this desk tomorrow? asked Jessie .
Well, said Mike, now it’s all over, it was my mystery, wasn’t it? 
You know, Grandfather, said Benny, I must have been seeing things.
Maybe you won’t have to worry about those men any longer, he said.
Then we can tell him we’d like to know more about what he is doing.
Oh, dear, what shall we do for another place to sit? asked Jessie .
Oh, please play it again! When did you learn to play? cried Violet.
He must be hiding the library books in the schoolhouse, said Benny.
We must have some bread, and cake is not good for Benny and Violet.
Right now you children have something new to think about, said Joe.
The thing was connected to a big machine that had a little screen .
It is very interesting work, but let me warn you, it isn’t all fun.
Where would Freddy go? Do you think he has a partner, Grandfather? 
It’s something like the way land animals feed on growing plants and
I have to go to San Francisco on business and I thought it would be
We ought to go down to see Rita the first thing we do, said Violet.
Now let’s be sure we have thought of everything we want, so I won’t
If the man is a partner of Willet’s, why would he come by himself? 
When Bill wakes up, we must give him something to eat, said Jessie.
They say there’s enough plankton in the deep sea to feed the world.
I feel better, said the old man, looking into the girl’s kind face.
Well, I never saw anything like that! exclaimed Commander Williams.
Are you trying to make up for being late yesterday? Suzanne asked .
Now, please take him back to the classroom and put him in his cage.
We’ll have to solve the other mysteries first, I guess, said Henry.
Fenton, I’m going to show you something I don’t show all my guests.
Well, packing bullets and cartridges and gunpowder in candle boxes.
I’d like to see how that breadfruit is getting along, said Jessie .
We are going to an island in the South Seas, said his grandfather .
It’s good clean dirt, though, said Benny, looking at his own hands.
That must be interesting work, said Jessie to Alice, shaking hands.
Davis, runs the train, but the conductor tells him when to stop and
It’s a special place that all mamas have where babies can start and
Well, maybe there’s an old picture of George Washington, said Benny.
Those two will always be in trouble unless we do something about it.
That dish tells us more than anything else we have found, said Joe .
I will say that you are Captain Daniel’s old friend and a handy man.
Do you know who gave me the prize on Field Day? he asked the doctor.
Little boy, said Bill suddenly, how much money was in that tin box? 
I did worry, said Peter, when I saw you were blaming that other boy.
I think this is an old ax-head! he cried, turning it over and over .
You go, girl! said Poppy’s grandparents, who were her biggest fans .
That’s just right, Benny! Now listen! If we could get a good stove— 
Well, I thought it was an awfully strange thing to ask, said Benny .
You children seem to have fun just being kind to somebody, said Mrs.
I wish Grandfather could see us eating your fish, Benny, said Henry.
Well, well, well! This telephone call is costing you a lot of money.
I’m sure it’s all right to ring a doorbell, even if we don’t get in.
That’s to put on Benny or Watch if he should get on fire, she said .
The minute they see a sign here saying PIES they will all come over.
Almost everyone forgets something or loses something, said Mr. Smith
Let’s stay in the motel until the whole thing is solved, said Benny.
That’s all right, Jessie, said Benny, taking his last drink of milk.
Don’t forget we still have to find that branch with two forks in it.
He knew I wanted a set of things like this, to fix cuts, said Henry.
Maybe he gets it in a covered pail, said Benny, looking at Mr. Smith
Isn’t it funny to see grown-up men digging in the sand, said Benny .
It’s long past noon and we were so excited we forgot our own dinner.
He laughed until his mothercame out to see what he was laughing at .
Yes! Isn’t it great? said Papa Bear, admiring the mall decorations .
Nobody could move all these things very far and then move them right
We’ll get a big bottle of cream then, Jessie, said Henry, laughing .
So, did anything exciting happen at school today? her mother asked .
I have spent nine years seeking perfection, and now I have found it.
Yes, I can get all the books you want by signing for them, he said .
I never can thank you enough for bringing Peter home! said Mr. Smith
Were you guys looking for this? she asked as she walked in the door .
I could never stand hundreds of people running all over my ranch—your
Well, it looked okay to me, Benny said, climbing up the ladder again.
You see, the people who rent this boatcan name it anything they like.
But how do we stop the bus driver? That’s the question, said Jessie .
You mean you like the idea of making pies for a living? asked Jessie.
Moore, do you mean you knew who he was all this time? asked Mr. Smith
Then she went right along without stopping, What’s the matter, Mike? 
But Papa wassharpening his ax on his grinding stone and didn’t hear .
If they grow to like you before they know who you are, things will be
Dancing is just not for you, said the people in charge of the ballet.
I’m glad we don’t have to wear fancy clothes like that with all those
He is our father’s father, and he didn’t like our mother, said Henry.
It’s great! Henry shouted, as he sat on the raft Come on out, Jessie.
You know, said Violet slowly, you see things the way an artist would.
It’s very good sand for houses, too, said Benny, running down to it .
Henry’s canoe can carry the other blanket roll and the bag of dishes.
These new fingers are the answer to every fish’s problem, said Barry.
The first thing we have to do is get rid of all this junk! she said .
You go off riding all over the country and leave me here alone so that
There, ringing a bell, wasa rather skinny Santa with a scraggly beard.
This is a wonderful book for us! It’s all about the Revolutionary War.
How would you like to go to bed? You get busy and think of something I
Do you see how much better Molly looks? That’s because of the oats you
We could sleep in the car! That’s what this station wagon is made for.
She thinks she’s selfish to practice, when we came down here to have a
If we liked it, we could have all we wanted just for sending boats out
He couldn’t have been more than a boy then, Henry said to his brother.
Let’s go right now, said Benny, just as if he had never cried at all .
Couldn’t Watch go, too? asked Benny, with his hand on the dog’s head .
Things always seem to happen to this family when we don’t expect them.
Yes, sir!  let me tell you, the people on this island save everything.
I should say tomorrow would be better because we must have a full day.
Here’s the station, Henry called out, as the car came to a quick stop .
They will stop people from knocking on our door all the time and asking
We could cut birds out of heavy paper and color them—every bird we see.
You know, I feel as if something will happen soon, said Violet slowly .
I should say he crawled in and hid it as far back as he could, said Dr.
How would you like to come back to our place for dessert? said Brother.
You can have a whole room, Mike, if you come to Aunt Jane’s, said Benny.
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we found something? Some clue? cried Henry .
The four children are living in a boxcar, but I shall not tell Mr. Smith
Benny talks as if we were really going to rent your houseboat, Mr. Smith
The Grizzmore Grille, please, said the cubs as they piled into the car .
Will you leave him here, just to please me? We can dig some other day in
He was glad to please Benny and get a little work done at the same time.
I suppose we could get a book about shells from the library, said Henry.
we could pick up shells and study the water birds, said Violet quietly .
I just got to thinking how nice it would have been if y hadn’t run away! 
That’s because they did not know the things were antiques, said Mr. Smith
Can I go back to the canoes and see if I can find any food? asked Benny .
Do you think we ought to give these pictures to the police? asked Benny .
What do you do in kindergarten? Sister asked as they sat down for lunch .
We could have the nicest little home here, and we could find some dishes.
But, Miss Jane, Maggie said, what could possibly happen to you out here? 
Remember Bill sold two race horses and went away without giving Mr. Smith
There was one pail under the window I couldn’t see very well, said Benny.
While you are waiting, you could do some digging with a stick, called Joe.
I’ll be glad to help you build a fire, if that’s what you want, said Joe .
Enough for two more dinners, said Henry, very pleased, and more will grow.
I say, that’s a big one! It was exactly as if an Englishman were speaking.
Do you mean that all of that Indian dust is really uranium? asked Violet .
He showed the doctor the bent nails and was told that he could have those.
Let’s race the dogs, Ben, cried Mike, who could never be still very long .
Yes, I remember seeing that pile of shells when I was a boy, said Mr. Smith
Now, what do you think about Peter’s parents? Do you think they are alive? 
Yes, Major’s going on the same train with you, in a boxcar, added Mr. Smith
if you came down with the gimmies, we went right home and you got nothing! 
Benny, does all this mean you want to go mountain climbing? asked Mr. Smith
You can do all my digging if you want, and I will take the clams out foryou.
I didn’t know you could swim like that! I didn’t know you could swim at all.
It means we’d better stop talking and get started on this trip, said Benny .
It could be the same one who made the pattern with the stones, said Jessie .
Now, began Henry, let’s look around and see what could make a grating noise.
It was so exciting that we could hardly pay attention to our schoolteaching.
Joe, whispered Benny, couldn’t we talk to Bill now? He seems all right to me.
It’s easy, said Peter, if there is something you want at the top of the tree.
See those wood planks this closet is made of? If we could only pry them off— 
Doesn’t it look something like an olive?  speaking of olives, I wonder if Mrs.
Would you like to see it done? My sister is putting on those curly tails right
Really, said Jessie, we could have a lovely time in a lighthouse, Grandfather.
Do look at this dear little kitchen stove! I wish we could get our own supper.
I guess they tried to make Bill give them the money, and Bill couldn’t find it
Well, said Henry, if someone lives there, we might find something new any day.
I smell smoke! Where’s that sandbox? I want that sand ready if there’s a fire.
I was just thinking what would I do, if we went home, and we didn’t find them.
Do you know the shortest way? asked Grandfather, as they all got into the car .
There’s no other place here where hecould hide the bigger things he has traded.
But what shall we have to eat? I suppose we ought to have some meat for dinner.
Dear Aunt Jane, said Violet softly, do you mean three men came into your room? 
Osgood—and I’m not saying it is—how do you think he’ll look? asked Grandfather .
Hey, Katie Kazoo, what do you have for lunch? George whispered into Katie’s ear .
If you don’t mind, please let me do the digging, will you? Just sit and watch me.
Now, do you want to work just a little more? I’d like to dig under the pile before
We wouldn’t want to be arrested, would we? Even if we hadn’t done anything wrong? 
But if we do, the staging has to wait, and it takes that much longer to finish it.
Maybe Bill and I could paper and paint the rooms before school begins, said Henry .
Do you think there are any sand paintings in our field now? Benny asked hopefully .
Er— said embarrassed Papa to the toy seller, two of those rubber pussycats, please.
Please! Please! shouted the cubs so loudly that the whole parking lot took notice .
I should think the beavers would run away if they saw us watching them, said Benny .
Hello, everybody! Fishing? said the man, as if he had never seen the Aldens before .
Well, said Grandfather slowly, if you are really going, I should tell you some more.
Oh, Sim, said Jessie, how about a bathroom in this house? Can you put in a bathroom? 
Would you like to come with us? I’m going to have a look and see how the baby’s doing.
I could never forget the girl who makes apple pies with a green bottle, said Mr. Smith
Maybe Grandfather and I could go fishing, said Benny, but we might not catch anything.
Then we could cut down some small trees and put the birds on the branches, said Jessie.
How can I write the names of these shells when we don’t know their names? asked Violet.
Don’t you keep wishing that you could take time off and look in the cave? asked Benny .
Chef, called Patrice the saucier, do you smell what I smell? The chef furrowed his brow.
How could Sister havehelped noticing? The buzz of the busy hovering bees filled the air .
We carry that money around as if it were just pieces of old paper, said Violet laughing .
Well, if you want to spend your two weeks that way, it’s all right with me, said Mr. Smith
Grandfather! he said, couldn’t we go into the little yellow house? I do wish you’d let us.
We are so hungry we could eat the chairs, but I will not open the books untilafter we eat.
I suppose, said Sister, that Santa could just skip the chimney and come in the front door.
Well, it is, Henry went on, and now what do you want for a present? We will buy it for you.
I couldn’t have toast for breakfast, said Benny, and I thought maybe crackers would be good.
That looks even better than the Bucking Duck! May we ride it,please? May we? May we? Please! 
Well, I see the man hiding and the face of another man farther away, if that’s what you mean.
Do you want to come to the police station with us? asked Captain De Rosa, speaking to Henry .
It was wide by a mile! Call yourself an umpire! Mama, please! hissed Sister from the sideline.
He hadbought the spookiest monster mask he could find, and Mama made the rest of the costume .
Well, maybe he didn’t beat, said Mike, but how could he beat when he didn’t know where to run? 
You may live here, too, if you like my house, remarked his grandfather, watching Henry’s face .
So, what do you want to do this afternoon? Katie’s mom asked as she sipped slowly at her drink.
Let’s see, now, he said, we’ll stop at our houses first—ours, Freddy’s, Lizzy’s, and Queenie’s.
She must care about the children of the island if she lets them use the schoolhouse this summer.
I could drink that myself! Violet said, watching Jessie mix the orange juice with a beaten egg .
What in the world do you want with two bunches of clothesline and a ball of string? asked Jessie .
Do you have chickens? Then, without waiting for an answer, she went right on, You havedone good work.
I was nearly fooled into selling this ranch! That’s what could happen, the little old lady answered .
Oh, Benny! I don’t know! I’m so tired! You want to know everything! Why do you want to ask about toads
That was my idea, too, remember! People will pay anything if you tell them their family is in trouble.
Well, do you remember we got cheated out of it? Joe and Alice had to go abroad and we couldn’t go alone.
Well, Benny, how would you like to learn something yourself? Come with me to the Easton family and watch
Isn’t it funny? How could it come here all by itself? I don’t seeanother rock anywhere around that’s like it.
But this bear must have a tail, replied Benny, knowing that Jessie would put on two tails if he asked her to .
You know, warned Brother, if your list is too long, Santa Bear might think you’re greedy, and not bringyou anything.
Don’t you know that you and your screaming is disturbing the baby bird who is trying to take a snooze inside this egg? 
But think back—how would you have liked it when you were a cub if some little girlcould outrun, outclimb, and outhit you? 
At the end of the act, Cho-Cho always said, ‘What do you want to do now, Major?’ and thehorse would lie down and shut his eyes.
Well, push it back and forth with your tongue, and maybe it’ll come out, yawned Brother, as he turnedover to go back to sleep .
Grandfather, she asked, couldn’t you use some of that money to fix up the little yellow house on SurpriseIsland? It is so dusty and the chairs are so old.
It isn’t fair! Come, we’re going back there and make them take youinto their silly club—and if they don’t, I’m going to tear that clubhouse limb from limb! 
The reason you should never talk to a stranger and never ever take presents from a stranger and neverever ever go anywhere with a stranger is that it’s dangerous.
