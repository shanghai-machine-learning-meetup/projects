Even a statement very close to the periphery can be held true in the face of recalcitrant experience by pleading hallucination or by amending certain statements of the kind called logical laws.
In this review I will not deal with those criticisms or with the details of the valuable case studies with which Kuhn tries to support his views; rather I will concentrate on certain concepts .

There is therefore no question as there was with the teleological model of being confronted with a choice between a scientific perspective and a standpoint which embodies quite different values.
Giddens is notable within the current upsurge of interest in general social change for his insistence that current transformations constitute a continuation of rather than a break with modernity.

The Tarskian account of truth held that a theory was true just in case every statement constituting its logical content was true and in practice a statement's logical content was to be fixed by its entailments.
what can be defined in the kinetic theory therefore can be seen to conform to the pattern that has been described at the beginning of the present section: we are again dealing with two incommensurable concepts.
from epoch to epoch should we try to find some underlying characterization that determines how the different sets are generated or should we rest content with studying a particular science at a particular time

He was fundamentally concerned with the success of rationalization with its spread from the seedbed origins of Calvinistic Protestantism to infest all Western cultures and to set up an iron cage for all moderns.
In brief it does not follow that theories cannot be regarded as "genuine statementsand cannot therefore be investigated for their truth or falsity merely because theories have indispensable functions in inquiry.
Merton was perfectly well aware that these values are by no means always characteristic of the way in which scientists conduct their affairs but he clearly regarded them as norms which on the whole are observed.
