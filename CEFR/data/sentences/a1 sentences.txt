Henry and Gordon missed Thomas.
“Slow down, Thomas,” he called.
They walked to school together.

Rabbit went to the play kitchen.
“Thank you, Thomas,” said James.
He felt very unimportant indeed.
“Fizzling fireboxes!” he peeped.
James pretended he hadn’t heard.
“Thank you, Sir,” panted Thomas.
No … he’s stopped at a crossing.

The yellow sun is over the house.
It is like a balloon full of air.
Thomas’ pistons pumped withpride.
“I’m going to be late!” he cried.
“My very own medal!” said Thomas.
When you let it go, off it zooms.
He looked at the view of the sea.
Thomas searched the tracks ahead.
He often pretended to have a pet.
“The sky is leaking!” she peeped.
“I’d have to make too many trips.
When huckle and lowly came back, 
“I don’t think so,” Emily moaned.
“Neither do we,” said his father.

But Sir Topham Hatt had bad news.
Gertie followed a trail of grain.
“He’s a real hero,” Percy puffed.
Percy broke through the boulders.
“Cheese!” said Franklin, smiling.
Percy charged down Gordon’s Hill.
Papa, I do not like to complain, 
“You will help me?” Thomas asked.
Proteus said it was a magic lamp.
Percy returned to Tidmouth Sheds.
” He spoke to the Station Master.
Thomas had to stop at a junction.
Percy decided to help his friend.
Percy watched the mail disappear.
“Who is it from?” asked Franklin.

“X-rays don’t hurt,” explained Dr.
Suddenly, a new engine named Belle
He wanted to be a special visitor.
Out popped a big, humongous chick.
Soon Salty arrived at his new job.
Beatrice and Carl made sandwiches.
“It must be Proteus’ magic lamp!” 
There was Harold—the race was on! 
There were all the other engines!

There weredanger signs everywhere.
Franklin let out a very deep sigh.
“Everyone back on board, please!” 
“Percy, I’ve been looking for you.
But Farmer McColl was still cross.
“Hooray for Flynn!” Thomas peeped.
Thomas got to the end of the line.
But James didn’t listen to Thomas.
“Bunnies are nice,” said Franklin.
“I don’t know,” she said out loud.
“Are you all right?” called Percy.
Percy was very pleased to see him.
And he steamed back to the castle.

Later Emily puffed towards Thomas.

“And I broke Farmer McColl’s eggs.

And that made Thomas nervous, too.

“That would showJames and Emily!” 
He rummaged through his toy chest.
“No thank you, James,” said Percy.
And everyone must wait their turn.
“That will be just fine,” said Dr.
He dives to the bottom of the sea.
Maybe we can see them in Tidmouth.

Duncan chuffed in to talk to James.
“There’s nothing to be scared of!” 
It was Bear’s turn to be surprised.
“Cinders and ashes!” gasped Thomas.
They worked in an old logging camp.

He was thinking about the children.
“I used to hate cabbage,” she said.
Then he pulled up to the front car.
“The Express is going to be late!” 
Franklin thought for a few moments.
“Here’s the next sight,” he puffed.
He just couldn’t say them out loud.
“That was close!” thought Beatrice.
James knew he should have listened.
Lay out the picnic things, my dear.
Gordon couldn’tsee the line ahead! 
“We’ll do our best,” peeped Thomas.
Soon they heard a familiar buzzing.
The chimps screeched with laughter.
He was having the time of his life.
Harold soared over the countryside.
“What a lovely view!” he exclaimed.
But Franklin wanted something else.
Gossie and Gertie are best friends.

“I just wanted to be Really Useful.
Harold the Helicopter loves flying.
“I need to keep this safe,” he said.

from the chasm in Copplethorpe Road.
He wanted to go fast more than ever.
“A rabbit?” asked Franklin’s mother.
So you’regoing to have to try it on.
Nothing can bother our picnic here! 
He wants me to pull a Special Train.
“Thingummy,” interrupted Mr Pickles.
It was good to have his friend back.
After that, Thomas worked very hard.
Now you remember this spot, my dear.
“I’m going to push back the rocks!” 
everything there is to see on Sodor.
“Maybe it’s a ghost,” guessed Percy.
“It’s been a long day,” he muttered.
Thomas searched all over the island.
“Maybe it will make you feel better.
And Harold’s bright light flickered.
“Flatten my funnel!” sniffed Gordon.
“Hurry, Thomas! Take me to the show.
He looked it Miss Ingleby hopefully.
Some rolled to the edge of a stream.
“Harold is in trouble!” Percy cried.
The noisiest of all was ahelicopter.
Everyone was happyto have seen them.
But Franklin didn’t need a prompter.
Percy found himself under the chute.
Finally it was time to go to school.
“My hat is ruined,” cried Lady Hatt.
James thinks he is the better train.
One for the teacher, one for himself
Franklin and Bear were the same age.
“Maybe you should get a new blanket.
But Franklin didn’t want to wake up.
Percy thought this was a grand idea.
“And you, Percy, are a Really Useful
And once again he got out his spade.
“Meatballs!” he chuckled to himself.
“Scrap you?” boomed Sir Topham Hatt.
Soon it was time for the decorating.
He even had abest friend named Bear.
Percy got to the Docks just in time.
“Stop, Thomas!” cried Farmer McColl.
“Why pick on the penguins?” he said.
Now Thomas knew he had to go slowly.
The bus ride seemed very, very long.
“All right,” said his driver kindly.
Sir Topham Hatt was proud of Thomas.
It is a paper dragon for the parade.
“An achoo-choo train,” Percy peeped.
“I think I know where Percy is, Sir.
He peeped hello, butnobody answered.
Everyone had an important job to do.
Gertie followed a shiny blue beetle.
Thomas went back and got the coaches.
“The Grand Opening is this afternoon.
Fred ran to his airplane on the tree.
Fred stepped into his green airplane.
A pet costs money to buy and to keep.
“My net is too heavy!” wailed Harold.
“The real problem is outside the zoo,
“Close the drains?” asked Mr Pickles.
“Today we open the big, big bridge!” 
“Asparagus!” said Franklin’ s father.
The Cat family lives in a nice house.
“Of course not, Sir,” replied Thomas.
“Now I can move back into the coop!” 
Percy took Thomas to the Dieselworks.
“Calm down, Thomas,” said his driver.
Gordon grumbled as he pulled coaches.
“Try not to think about the audience.
But sometimes there is too much work.
It read: Dear Tooth Fairy, This is a 
He pulls both passengers and freight.
But sometimes Franklin was forgetful.
“Are you sure, Diesel?” Percy peeped.
“Now, where shall we tie the ropes?” 
“But that’s stealing,” said Franklin.
“I hope I get some money,” said Bear.
The signal moved to show “line clear.
“Not now, Thomas,” Percy interrupted.
Franklin nodded his head up and down.

But Thomas knew he couldn’t speed up.
think about things for days and days.
“I’ll go first,” Thomas said at last.
Then Franklin went to Beaver’s house.
Sir Topham Hatt started the big hunt.
Now they were busy trimming the tree.
Farmer McColl was waiting for Thomas.
“It’s a special blue,” said Franklin.
“Plainly, this fellow is…a sweater!" 
With a sword, and a gun, and an ax!ï 
There was black smoke on the horizon.
With asigh, he gave it to the trucks.
“It’s Thomas!” Percy peeped to Whiff.
“It makes room for my grown-up teeth.
Franklin and his mother sniffed, too.
First, she woke Humbert from his nap.
“They won’t escape,” said Mr Pickles.
“It’s the place to be seen,” he said.
“It’s not like stealing,” said Moose.
James’ face was soon covered in soot.
Tiles had blown off thestation roofs.
Back at the zoo, Mrs Crumble frowned.
How will they ever get out of there? 
“Here comes the dragon,” says Thomas.
Nothing but dung,” said Miss Ingleby.
“You have caused confusion and delay.
So, the chickens ran for their lives.
“You’d better mind them,” Mavis said.
“Oh, no!” Emily had to wait for help.
“You were very helpful at Sports Day.
“Disgraceful,” said Gordon pompously.
“Thanks, Salty,” peeped Thomas sadly.
“Shall we move on?” asked Mr Pickles.
Suddenly, Diesel slid up next to him.
Some rocks hadfallen across his path.
He wheeshed happily up Gordon’s Hill.
“Sir, you need Flynn the Fire Engine.
She could shoot water from her tanks.
Only Kevin listened to Percy’s story.
“He has caused confusion and delay!” 
They lived in the same neighbourhood.
Thomas pulled into Maithwaite Station.
“Better hurry, Bertie!” peeped Thomas.
Thomas heard passenger-car doors slam.
“Black Loch is a nice route after all.
He has run out of coal,” he announced.
Because of you, none of my engines has

asked why everyone was wearing a mask.
He was thinking about the broken eggs.
I say we get rid of that juggling pug.
He decided to go by the canal instead.
“Don’t be silly,” said Thomas bravely.
But Percy wasn’t enjoying being Percy.
“I’ll have to get more film,” he said.
We are going to go on a picnic today! 
“I’ll stand by with the rescue team!” 
Franklin stood on stage beside Badger.
“I knew trains were faster than buses.
he stopped off to see his friend Doug.
Gordon only does it to feel important.
“Come on!” Thomas gently pushed Henry.
“I’m sure I could solve those clues!” 
“I have work to do,” huffed Peter Sam.
“I know all my colours, too,” he said.
What wonderful news! Everyone cheered.
“I have a bad feeling about this snow.
Franklin’s mother looked at the clock.
“It’s windy up there—very, very windy.
“It’s big!” clucked the small chicken.
“Hurry up, hurry up,” Skarloey puffed.
“I don’t have any teeth,” he answered.
“And I, my dear, will find a solution.
“James,” he asked, “why are you red?” 
What is up there on top of that tree? 
We can’t be too careful about signals.
when we were young, we picnicked here.
He was puffing harder than he had ever
“I think I know what smells,” he said.
Would you like to fly in an airplane?

“What about the rhinos?” said Mr Raja.
“Really Useful Engines are never late.
” And he puffed back to Tidmouth Sheds
“Sir Topham Hatt told me to stay here.
“Not now, dear,” said Sir Topham Hatt.
There was a big crowd at the bus stop.
Thomas peeped happily as he passed by.
James raced back to the coaling plant.
The two engines chuckled and chortled.
“Well, it isn’t snowing yet,” he said.
At last, they reached Franklin’s room.
“We couldn’t have done it without him.
“We’ll think about it,” they answered.
Something was lying by the side of the
Now Percy had to put out a fire, too! 
Soon they will hatchand be baby birds.
It was windy up there, too—very windy.
One morning, Thomas’ wish was granted.
“Off we go, off we go!” they chuckled.
“Peep, peep!” he whistled impatiently.
Anyone would think they were children.
Owl directed everyone to their places.
It was a special day for the railway! 
Rabbit thumped his feet in excitement.
They were helping to build a new line.
So he didn’t know where it would lead.
“Please don’t scrap me, Sir,” he said.
“Now I can take it to Sir Topham Hatt.
There was a moment of stunned silence.
They agreed to help him load the wood.
Sir Topham Hatt will come and see you.
“You’re on Misty Island,” huffed Bash.
Slowly but surely, Toby began to move.
It glowed a fiery red in the distance.
The other engines were already asleep.
The other engines grumbled dreadfully.
“This remindsme of a time in Bimini ….
“That’s over a year!” said Mr Pickles.
The chickens all began to boo hoo hoo.
“That’s what being brave is all about.
“The pirate’s treasure’s right here!” 
The air in the balloon cooled and the 
Later, Thomas had to wait at a signal.
The next day, the pictures were ready.
Is our pumpkin under the water, duck? 
The Fireman scrambled to the cab roof.
“Steamies don’t go to the Dieselworks.
“How will I get home?” Thomas wondered.
“Hurry, Thomas! Why do you go so slow? 
Maybe it’s enough just tobelieve in it.
“Huff your hardest,” he said to Thomas.
He has two faithful coaches of his own.
One day, Percy stopped at the airfield.
“You should be at work,” called Thomas.
But Thomas was the happiest one of all.
“Do you smell something odd?” he asked.
“Then you hear a strangecreaking sound.

can ask Thomas to tell Sir Topham Hatt.
One morning, he was very cheeky indeed.
She was obviously stark-raving bonkers.
“One of her own teeth?” asked Franklin.
“This is a Best Dressed Engine contest.
“Don’t worry, Thomas,” said his driver.
He had never seen cars likethis before.
“Hurry up, slow coach,” wheeshed Percy.
They play hide-and-seek in the daisies.
He’d have time to see the golden eagle.
Salty told them there were three clues.
Useful engines work together,” he said.
“Peep, peep!” And Thomas was off again.
“Okay,” said Franklin in a small voice.
Sir Topham Hatt came to Tidmouth Sheds.
He’d like you to visit the Dieselworks.
Ahead in the fog, he saw an eerie glow.
“Well done, Percy,” shouted the Driver.
And branches had fallen onto the lines.
He played only after his work was done.
He wanted to be a Really Useful Engine.
Franklin took the film to be developed.
Stand behind me and I will protect you.
Then Thomas arrived, his rods rattling.
The visitors looked out of the windows.
“We’ll all drown! Run for your lives!” 
Just then, the rails started to quiver.
“That way you won’t see anything scary.
The tiller spins and the captain yawns.
“What’s that?” asked Franklin’s father.
He rattled off to tell Sir Topham Hatt.
He steamed off to collect the children.
“I like my old blanket,” said Franklin.
Next she rubbed some cream on his hand.
He started off juggling just for a hug.
For Sandi, who was born to perform – B.
Anemergency plan,” he added decisively.
“What’s happening?” Peter Sam whistled.
Where are we going on our picnic, dad? 
“Relax,” said the big, humongous chick.
When he was finished, everyone cheered.
He liked to throw logs, not stack them.
“What’s so urgent about this package?” 
He raced to find Flynn the Fire Engine.
And that made Thomas a bit afraid, too.
“We’re the Logging Locos,” puffed Dash.
He was trying extra hard to stay clean.
Franklin looked through the viewfinder.
“I already have a full tummy,” he said.
“Sir Topham Hatt says you need my help.
Beaver was carrying her favourite book.
“Hold back, hold back,” they screeched.
“I get to the middle and then I forget.
Percy was as happy as he had ever been.
Thomas will take the judge to the show.
Is our pumpkin in the leaf pile, duck? 
“Choc Ice on wheels!” chipped in Henry.
A sudden gust of wind shook the bridge.
Rabbit pulled out a brand-new notebook.
Thomas had never been this way before….
Thomas heard a passenger-car door slam.
“Maybe you have stage fright,” said Mr.
Thomas backed up to where Henry waited.
Percy and Thomas were especially happy.
“I’ve got an important job to do later.
… and there was Harold the Helicopter! 
“About fifty grams,” said Miss Ingleby.
“But I’ve finished operating,” said Dr.
“Just wait until I tell Sergeant Saddle
Percy slowly rolled to the Dieselworks.
Plop! A handful of cold, slimy brussels
A large bluebottle settled on his nose.
“It isn’t serious, Franklin,” she said.
It was an elephant! And he looked cross.
“Down the hole,” gasped Sergeant Saddle.
“I don’t believe there’s a magic lamp!” 
And sometimes he rides in a helicopter! 
“I’m ready!” said Beatrice with a smile.
Ted checked the oil in his red airplane.
“What about your bunny?” asked Franklin.
“Everyone must be on board!” he thought.
The jet engine starts up! Vroom! Vroom! 
Thomas felt very proud to be taking him.
Perhaps then my wishes would cometrue!” 
He took Sam, his stuffed dog, for walks.
All the narrow-gauge engines were there.
Sir Topham Hatt and Captain raced out to
Franklin’s parents looked at each other.
“I’m putting on your snowplow,” he said.
Gordon and the Express were pulling out.
when they couldn’t remember their lines.
Now all the villages had plenty of coal.
They were fixing the station-house roof.
Especially not ones made up by himself! 
“What on earth is—?” shouted Mr Pickles.
“The new line looks splendid!” she said.
In the kitchen, Daddy washes the dishes.
But another good spot has just gone bad.
“The more the merrier!” said Mr Pickles.
Thomas was alone and very, very worried.
“I don’t have any teeth,” said Franklin.
It had snowed a little eachday all week.
Sir Topham Hatt gave Henry a stern look.
Sir Topham Hatt is very pleased with us.
The Diesels were very happy to see them.
“They need extra-special care, you know.
But Thomas had forgotten about the race.
And a little blue engine covered in mud.
Thomas’ driver looked over his shoulder.
Toby trundled to collect new roof tiles.
Bash told Thomas he was on Misty Island.
“First, find the eagle of the mountains.
Thomas steamed into the Fishing Village.
He could zip zippers and button buttons.
He can put his head in a lion’s mouth … 
Bear poked and prodded Franklin’s shell.
“Let’s start quickly before they see us.
Franklin pretended to click the clicker.
Percy knew he’d made a terrible mistake.
“Dirty cars from dirty sidings! Yecch!” 
“Please tell me what’s wrong,” she said.
“He must go to the scrap yards tomorrow.
“I want to get out,” demanded Lady Hatt.
Back at the Shed, Gordon ignores Thomas.
Franklin ran his tongue around his gums.
“He won’t last five minutes,” said Bill.
So he pulled away as gently as he could.
Thomas and the Logging Locos were saved.
“We can’t let a little mountain stop us.
But Franklin got carried away and said a
I want to see the new line from the air.
“What’s wrong?” asked Franklin’s mother.
He must know I’m a Really Useful Engine.
“Don’t worry!” called Skarloey’s Driver.
Percy often has the dirtiest work to do.
“That will do, Bertie,” said his Driver.
But then they all heard a strange sound.
Owl to help him read his favourite book.
He was sure the golden eagle would come.
Diesel snorted goodbye and slipped away.
“Snowplows look silly!” Thomas grumbled.
“Go find Harold,” Gordon called to Henry.
Thomas and Henry chugged to the platform.
“Now look what you’ve done!” he wheeshed.
My dad can take charge in an emergency … 
The steep tracks didn’t tire him at all! 
Thomas saw that there was no ghostat all.
and Rocky would finally get his own shed.
Thomas and the Logging Locos were saved! 
James was very rude whenever he saw them.
You were brave, cool-headed, and helpful.
“Well, they eat dung,” said Miss Ingleby.
Franklin and hisfriends bowed four times.
“I will have to speak to Sir Topham Hatt.
But Sir Topham Hatt had made up his mind.
“He is not so scary anymore,” says Percy.
Then Thomas made an incredible discovery.
At last, the jet engine runs out of fuel.
He was proud to be a narrow-gauge engine.
“I think railways are slow,” said Harold.
“So may I have a pet, please?” he begged.
“All right,” Thomas grumbled reluctantly.
“What are you doing here?” snorted James.
Just then, Toby came by on an open track.
Franklin went over the lines in his head.
“I know who owns the camera!” he shouted.
“It is good to tell someone,” says Percy.
Finally, she filled a balloon with water.
“And I made this for you,” said Franklin.
But the thing that he does best of all … 
Then they nodded their heads up and down.
Something sticky splashed all over James.
“What about the chimps?” asked Mr Chisel.
And Thomas steamed over to Maron Station.
Franklin went home and ate a nice supper.
“Sir Topham Hatt knows I’m a fine engine.
It was wintertime on the Island of Sodor.
“This will numb your hand,” she told him.
Mr Leaf, the lion keeper, spoke up first.
“I didn’t know eggs and spoons had races.
It was summertime on the Island of Sodor.
Thomas had a big red banner on his tanks.
And now look where those dogs are going! 
His freight cars were full of roof tiles.
We can take it to the vet if it getssick.
“I’ll ask Thomas to tell Sir Topham Hatt.
We sure know how to find a pumpkin, duck.
“Woe is me!” clucked the smaller chicken.
“You’re a quarry diesel now,” Mavis said.
Duck and the Trucks rushed down the hill.
The hose muststill be at the Dieselworks.
“I’ll catch Edward or bust,” said Bertie.
“Hurry, hurry!” Annie and Clarabel cried.
How does george ride high up in the sky? 
They were going to play a trick on Percy.
Thomas’ riders were enjoying spring, too.
Three dogs at a party on a boat at night.
They agreed to help him collect the logs.
Can you name all the parts of your body? 
“Oh! Is this all you brought?” he tooted.
He could count by twos and tie his shoes.
“Oh, thank you, Sir! She will be pleased.
“I can take it down the hill,” said Toby.
“Yes, there’ll be mountains of the stuff.
It was just the fog man with his lantern.
At last the new Dieselworks was finished.
Mind you, they—like the croc—also thought
They searched high—and they searched low.
Sir Topham Hatt was laughing and smiling.
“It’s not fair—I can be fast and careful.
“Iwill take good care of a real pet, too.
“Farmer McColl gave the brokenones to me.
In the morning, no fans greeted Beatrice.
But now he chuffed on even more slowly ….
“Wake up now, Franklin,” said his mother.
“I have an idea,” said Franklin’s father.
“Me too! Me too!” cried Moose and Rabbit.
Emily steamed on through the countryside.
He’s fast and fearless! He’s a real hero.
“And anyway, I don’t think our neighbours
He’s a giggling, wiggling, juggling pug! 
“Number Twos!” said Mr Pickles, blushing.
Fred pushed his airplane onto the runway.
“Usefulness before cleanliness,” he added.
Luckily, a new engine named Belle arrived.
“There you are,” she cooed to the beetles.
“The chain to the steamboat has snapped!” 
Belle special care because she was a hero.
He didn’t know if he was ready for school.
Percy wanted friends who had time for him.
He delivered the fresh milk, just in time.
Fred put a new part on his green airplane.
And then, inch by inch, it began to emerge
But the Logging Locos didn’t like working.
Mrs Crumble was a little strange at times.
“He’s on Misty Island, andhe needs help!” 
“Are you all right, Thomas?” called Henry.
And every last one of my sodas is chugged.
Nobody was home, so he pooped on the rug! 
“How about a wee contest?” chuffed Duncan.
“Here comes Mister Show-off,” groused Ben.
“Bumpers and buffers! These are jobi logs.
“Are you keeping the camera?” asked Moose.
“My driver saw the ghost train last night.
Percy proudly puffed ahead of the Diesels.
“I know all about tunnels,” Thomas puffed.
juggling act had won three years in a row.
The Narrow-Gauge Controller listened hard.
He invited Percy to visit the Dieselworks.
“We don’t need youto be breaking anything.
“They’re off to an ocean show in Tidmouth.
“Try to remember,” said Franklin’s mother.
“I don’t want X-rays,” whispered Franklin.
Lowly is in bed because he is still tired.
“Here comes Gordon,” cried the passengers.
“Humpf! Silly little engines,” he grunted.
Thomas and the LoggingLocos were trapped! 
Finally, Thomas heard the whirl of rotors.
Far out at sea, Thomas heard a loud crack.
“—And the captain yawns,” sang the trucks.
Percy’s favorite job is carrying the mail.
Peter Sam puffed to the top of the hill … 
They both squirt scent from their bottoms.
Everything was ready for the day to begin.
Henry crashed into Harvey’s freight car!! 
Fox swished his tail, and Rabbit twitched.
“I won!” And he waited eagerly for Thomas.
James was in the workshop being repainted.
He was too busy thinking what he would say
He wondered why they hadn’t invited him to
Flames flickered and flashed into the sky.
“If I find them, I can sail back to Sodor.
Diesel 10 whimpered and his claw crumpled.
“You got over your stage fright!” said Mr.
Do they dare go over great sleeping bear? 
“You’re a big engine, Henry!” Thomas said.
“You shouldn’t be afraid of a little wind.
“I played a trick on you,” chuffed Duncan.
Cranky let go of the cratehe was carrying.
“I’m taking Sir Topham Hatt to Sports Day.
wiggled and then, with a tug, it came out.
“Er, yes, thingummy,” agreed Miss Ingleby.
“Certainly not—I like my rails, thank you.
“Of course he’s not scared,” replied Bear.
“Yecch! What dirty objects!” he would say.
They knew there’d be music andlots of fun.
“But I still won the race,” tooted Bertie.
“So you must all be Really Useful Engines.
The jet engine rockets Thomas up the track.
And the chickens ran for their lives again.
Duncan was delivering coal to the villages.
James had to put his brakes on with a jolt.
James headed straight for the Branch Lines.
Sir Topham Hatt declared the new line open.
“I need to deliver this mail right on time.
“We can help you get a new Dieselworks, but
But he couldn’t stop thinking about medals.
Hurray! Hurray!” Bertie tore down the hill.
Everyone wanted to see the big, big bridge.
Her boiler quivered and her valves rattled.
Franklin’s friends shook their heads sadly.
There was even a little blood on the tooth.
Franklin’s first words were soft and raspy.
Two dogs in a house on a boat in the water.
“The Steamworks is ours,” roared Diesel 10.
And why the question mark? He texted back: 
“I’m the fastest—I’ll do the most journeys.
Then Harold arrived … with Sir Topham Hatt.
“Everyone out to see the seals,” he tooted.
They raced to find out what was the matter.
And he chuffed away as quickly as he could.
The heathad clearly gone to Mr Raja’s head.
But no words would come to the head keeper.
Is our pumpkin on top of the stump, goose? 
What is going on here? It was all amystery.
But just perfect forthrowing at each other.
“I didn’t mean to be late or cause trouble.
He had to show the visitors all the sights.
Just then, Gordon pulled up next to Thomas.
“Then I’ve got a bigger job for you, Salty.
Franklin was quiet for the rest of the day.
Soon the hot-air balloon rose into the sky.
It’s okay if sometimes he poops on the rug.
Who will take the judge to the train show? 
“Why can’t it go and buzz somewhere else?” 
a very small hen laid a big, humongous egg.
Bird-watchers are coming from far and wide.
Soon Thomas arrived at the Scottish Castle.
Why don’t you give it a try, me hearties?” 
The crocodile eyed Mrs Crumble sorrowfully.
He huffed and puffed as gently as he could.
At the airfield, there was another problem.
Raccoon was in charge of building the sets.
Raccoon pointed to the art supply cupboard.
Suddenly, an idea flew into Percy’s funnel.
“But I think whiskers might make me sneeze.
“It feels like it is full of jumping frogs.
“I’ll take as long as I like,” said Cranky.
He could see at a glance what was going on.
Just then, the engines saw a strange sight.
“I bet it won’t last,” she said to herself.
Percy works in the Yard at the Big Station.
It’s just an old storyand quite silly, too.
And Thomas chuffedaway as fast as he could.
golden eagle,” huffed Thomas as he set off.
And things work out when you work together.
After a while, a chilly wind began to blow.
Thomas was excited about the new rail line.
(She was not the sharpest beak in the flock.
Then Bertie had to stop at a level crossing.
“Toby is stuck on his branch line!” he said.
“We’re going to take some X-rays,” she said.
Sir Topham Hatt arrived with important news.
“The wood will arrive todayat Brendam Docks.
Toby clickety-clacked quickly down the hill.
“You have had a trying day, Percy!” he said.
“There’s a good chance,” replied the Driver.
“They’re not much use and quite out-of-date.
“Let’s work on them together,” suggested Mr.
“I’m so sorry about this,” gasped Mr Chisel.
“Oh! We know she’ll be perfect!” said a man.
And it came down right in front of Skarloey.
“You will have to be decorated,” said James.
It was anight he wanted to remember forever.
Harvey, still at full steam, rushed forward.
“He promised to be on time,” said Peter Sam.
Franklin hugged his mother, then his father.
“I didn’t take all the coal to the villages.
Is our pumpkin up in the apple tree, goose? 
“You’ll be home tomorrow,” she reminded him.
Unlike Beatrice, Carl made lots of mistakes.
His mother and father stared with amazement.
He was just in time to see Edward puff away.
“My train is long and heavy,” puffed Thomas.
“Buffer up, Belle!” shouted Sir Topham Hatt.
“But we have to cross!” Thomas said bravely.
OnceFranklin found a lucky four-leaf clover.
But the golden eagle was nowhere to be seen.
Thomas saw a hole in the roof of the tunnel.
At last, Thomas came to the end of the line.
Thomas puffed happily towards Brendam Docks.
and then a little bird dove into the water! 
“Where’s my package?” Sir Topham Hatt asked.
FRANKLIN could count forwards and backwards.
Spring was springing everywhere Thomas went.
“Wake up, Franklin,” called a faraway voice.
“What about dung beetles?” asked Mr Pickles.
“I will show them all the sights on Sodor!” 
Bertie and the passengers waitedimpatiently.
He wanted to go to the pet store right away.
“Now you have taught me something,” said Mr.
“Well done, Bertie!” shouted his passengers.
Percy was loading freight cars at the docks.
With Thomas gone, there was more work to do.
The workmen needed stone for their building.
James went redder than ever and snorted off.
“What do you call a train that has a cold?” 
Gordon the Express Engine was already there.
“All brussels sprouts stink,” said Franklin.
Besides, my branch line was clear yesterday.
Percy raced to the Search and Rescue Center.
“I feel air on my funnel,” Ferdinand peeped.
“And now the monster’s coming,”Emily gasped.
Theinnkeeper hurried out to unload supplies.
“That’sfunny,” said Thomas to the signalman.
But one dayFranklin found something special.
“Wait until you’ve tried it,” Thomas puffed.
At supper, Beatrice barely touched her food.
Franklin had wanted a pet since he was small.
“We’ll go to the doctor first thing tomorrow.
Franklin held up a photo of Raccoon’s family.
A nurse gave Franklin a special gown to wear.
“You look good enough to eat!” Thomas hooted.
“You’re a pouty puffer, Percy,” teased James.
“Emily, you will pull the Flour Mill Special.
“They don’t even have a crane,” Percy peeped.
Franklin woke up very early the next morning.
He decided to play a trick on Gordon instead.
Mr Pomfrey, the penguin keeper, was outraged.
Emily reached the murky waters of Black Loch.
Smearing stinky paste all around their cages.
Franklin and his friends were playing soccer.
Percy came upon the cart swiftly in the dark.
Everyone came together for the grand opening.
Sir Topham Hatt and Captain raced out to sea.
He asked his mother to help him write a note.
“A promise is a promise, and we must keep it.
“Thomas, where are the coaches?” he demanded.
“Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!” he panted to the cars.
Percy felt better, until he noticed the time.
